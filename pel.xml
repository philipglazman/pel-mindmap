        <description>The Partially Examined Life is a philosophy podcast by some guys who were at one point set on doing philosophy for a living but then thought better of it. Each episode, we pick a text and chat about it with some balance between insight and flippancy. You don't have to know any philosophy, or even to have read the text we're talking about to (mostly) follow and (hopefully) enjoy the discussion.

Your Citizen feed from Patreon offers access to old episodes and part 2's and 3's that may not be available to the cheapskate public. Thanks for supporting PEL!</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On selections about virtue and moral action from the &lt;em &gt;Summa Theologica &lt;/em &gt;(1268) as collected by Timothy McDermott in &lt;em &gt;Thomas Aquinas: Selected Philosophical Writings &lt;/em &gt;(1993).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the role of emotions in morality? Aquinas, following Aristotle, is well known for saying that reason is humanity's unique and primary virtue, but yet being reasonable is not just a matter of will but conditioning: education and practice, which involves not just the control of but the channeling of emotions, and all this is made possible by biological health.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These thinkers did not have our modern notion of psychology, of course, and approach the problem of virtue as a metaphysical one: Is virtue a disposition? Is it a disposition to &lt;em &gt;be &lt;/em &gt;something, or to &lt;em &gt;act &lt;/em &gt;in some way? Eventually Aquinas works up to a definition of virtue that he defends: virtues are good qualities of mind which dispose us to live rightly, which we cannot misuse, and which God works in us without our help. After defending each piece of this definition, he goes on to ask some technical questions about how virtue works within us. He concludes by asking what specifically virtue applies to: The intellect? The passions? The senses? The will? He distinguishes between those faculties which can actually display virtues (the intellect, the passions, the will) and ones which are merely preconditions for virtue (the senses, but also the rest of our biology; you can't be virtuous if you don't have a body).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;His analysis of the will is particularly strange: He claims that for self-regarding virtues, we don't need the will. If we're conditioned to have self-control (virtuous passions) and to recognize the right thing (virtuous intellect), then we'll invariably just do that. But to love something bigger than ourselves, whether it be God or the human species, Aquinas claims that a virtuous will is required.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;It's not essential to go back to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-378-aquinas-141584400" target="_blank"&gt;our previous treatment of Aquinas &lt;/a &gt;before listening to this, but you might want to at least listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-378-aquinas-142702723" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 378 part 4 on emotions &lt;/a &gt;. Our treatment of Aristotle's account of the various intellectual virtues was in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-147-aristotle-50938838" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 147 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We bring up a bit of the moral action section to provide context for this but don't go into that in detail until part three of this discussion. The problem is how evil can really exist, given that God is good and only creates good things. The solution is that "evil" is really just something not coming into its full potential. We all aim to do what we perceive to be good, but if we don't perceive rightly or our will doesn't follow through, then we're falling short of being the rational, fully put-together human beings we could be.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/selected-philosophical-writings-9780199540273" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the reading &lt;/a &gt;, which was compiled by Timothy McDermott in 1993, or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/selectedphilosop0000thom" target="_blank"&gt;try it out online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude our treatment (for now) of Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology &lt;/em &gt;, tackling the final two sections (238 and 239) of "The Certainty and Truth of Reason."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is he actually talking about in these sections? According to Robert C. Solomon's &lt;em &gt;In the Spirit of Hegel &lt;/em &gt;: "'Reason' refers to a sense of unity, between 'subject and object' in the jargon of the times, and this is the meaning that Hegel had learned from Kant and Schelling, in particular." &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So Kant's separation of the Subject (the world of appearance) and Thing-In-Itself is something to be overcome: A separation of the thinkable from reality is unstable and unsatisfying, but it's not clear to us why this is the case. Wes thinks it's because appearances have to have their structure fed to them by reality: Even for Kant, things-in-themselves can't be truly divorced from appearances, because we have to have some data that we can process to create appearances. Mark thinks this is a probably true but irrelevant argument; that his objection to the intractable divide between subject and object is simply that this is not a way that we can live, and not how we treat the world of appearance. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So where Wes' argument would hold FOR Kantianism against a "pure" idealism that didn't include things-in-themselves, Hegel is arguing instead AGAINST Kantianism of any sort: There can't be mere Things-In-Themselves at all, even if as Kant says these are mysteriously related to appearances. This is similar to Hegel's argument in the previous section against skepticism, which also involves separation between appearances and an unknown reality, except that the skeptical self is sharply delineated as an isolated being in a strange world it can't know, whereas idealism defines the self as the creator of all appearances, the owner of all it beholds, which likewise leaves it adrift and unrooted. True, Kant's response does tie down appearances somehow, but in a very unsatisfying way by Hegel's lights; it still leaves one in a fundamentally skeptical position, floating rootlessly. (Fichte's idealism would also be dismissible on the same grounds: In distinguishing between the empirical (objective) and ethical (subjective) self, Fichte is creating an unnecessary, unbridgeable division.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Marxist_Philosophy/Hegel_and_Feuerbach_files/Hegel-Phenomenology-of-Spirit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, on p. 143 at the bottom, PDF p. 179.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on "The Certainty and Truth of Reason," now starting on sec. 236 in Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;. Hegel has told us that there's something wrong with idealism as traditionally conceived, where the categories of being are all subdivisions of the "I." This leaves no room for fundamental "otherness," for the negative as a real part of the universe, which Hegel thinks is necessary for a fully adequate concept of Reason.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Remember that we're coming out of the previous section about development of the I through self-conscious apprehension of and by other people, so one of the dialectical oppositions here is the I as idealist ground for all existence and the I as an individual human being in a world with other humans. When it comes to the objective world explored by science, you and I provide different perspectives on these objects; we make them not just my solipsistic experience, but make them real, i.e. truly objective: things in opposition to any particular self. When it comes to mathematical and logical objects (e.g. the form of a syllogism), you and I are connecting to the same, seemingly unchanging realm of Reason a la Plato, though of course Hegel is going to ultimately see this experience as just a phase to be overcome, not as our connecting with and participating in the Divine. This section seems primarily focused on metaphysical objects: the Categories (substance, property, negation, number, etc.) and the Kantian Things-In-Themselves, which include the transcendental Ego (my Self as a metaphysical object). We don't &lt;em &gt;see &lt;/em &gt;these things, so we don't have multiple perspectives on them as we do on ordinary objects; we &lt;em &gt;think &lt;/em &gt;them, like the mathematical objects. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I'm not going to pretend we fully understand any of this, but we're trying!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Marxist_Philosophy/Hegel_and_Feuerbach_files/Hegel-Phenomenology-of-Spirit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, on p. 143, PDF p. 179.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/144182884" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;The Problem of Christianity &lt;/em &gt;(1913), talking about how communities refer to time-processes, both in the history of the development of that community (so a community can be much more ancient and wizened than an individual), and in the mythical history and looked-for future, such that the community, for instance, of Christians is defined by the death of Jesus (which, whether it really happened the way it was described or not, was certainly before Paul founded the church) and to a lesser degree by the end-times events described in the Biblical book of Revelation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whenever an American thinks "we fought the civil war," then that's an instance of community thinking, given that the current individual wasn't alive and so did not literally fight the civil war. Judaism is largely based on the idea of group historical experience. It's very different, then, when a group of Americans and/or Jews joins together to coordinate and celebrate some festival and when employees at a company work together to manufacture some product. In the latter case, there is likely not much shared identification of worker with company, though in some cases companies can foster this spirit so that workers feel they have a real stake and that their fortunes rise and fall with the company.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the latter part of the reading, Royce praises the philosophy that he attributes to St. Paul (but which is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-23-rousseau-11380725" target="_blank"&gt;Rousseau &lt;/a &gt;) that contrasts the ability to cooperate in a community with the individualism that society instills in us. Primitive people without a lot of sense of self find it easy to blend into a community. Civilization makes us into individuals, makes us identify our own interests, cultivate our own unique personalities with our own needs and tastes, sharpens our individual wills, and puts us in competition with others for status and resources. Of course, it's better to be more developed in this way, but to get the benefits of community, we have to then get over ourselves. (This is similar to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/03/29/ricoeur-on-the-second-naivete/" target="_blank"&gt;Ricoeur's account of a second naïveté &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Royce want the Christian world community to be one not of sheep-like submen, but enlightened people that use their developed, individual talents and sensibilities to work toward the common goal of peace on earth and love among all people. Whether or not Paul actually preached this explicitly, Royce points to Paul as an exemplar of this. Paul also created the framework of interpretation that others could then understand and follow to form the community of the early church, though the believers were of course fixated on Jesus as their (physically absent) leader, not Paul. The paradox of the ideal community is that it doesn't exist yet, and certainly doesn't exist in its ideally loveable state, so how can one thoroughly love it already? For it to become this loveable community, you'd have to &lt;em &gt;already &lt;/em &gt;have a bunch of loveable members (maybe everyone) loving each other. The leader therefore needs to be seen by the followers as having a great vision and a great love to get the ball rolling.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While this might seem to either doom the idea of such a community or at least marginalize it as only someone who already had faith in Christianity would countenance, on a smaller scale, it's a dynamic in starting any community: One can't participate in a community unless it pre-exists to join, yet since a community is by definition plural, a single founder can't just decide to have a community. So there is always some sort of initial faith in a leader by others, or perhaps something that is truly born cooperatively, but then at some point there's a schism such that one of the original leaders' vision wins out and other OGs leave the group (and maybe like Trotsky get killed)... something of the sort. Given the time period that this came out, which coincided with the birth of sociology (e.g. Durkheim), it may well be that a lot of what Royce is talking about here--group minds, the development of groups, individuals' devotion to groups--is not so strangely Hegelian but just a breed of early sociology.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;: We return to Thomas Aquinas with a three-part discussion of his views of virtue and ethics: Passage 36 and the first 20 pages of Passage 35 in Oxford's &lt;em &gt;Thomas Aquinas: Selected Philosophical Writings &lt;/em &gt;, compiled by Timothy McDermott in 1993.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On sections of &lt;em &gt;The Problem of Christianity &lt;/em &gt;(1913) which establish Royce’s concept of a community of interpretation: individuals working together with a sense of shared history and expectation. He claims that such a grouping can be counted as a literal mind and that it solves the problem of human meaning. Which of our many social groupings and political affiliations share these uplifting characteristics? Mark, Wes, and Seth are joined for the beginning of the discussion by Westminster’s &lt;a href="https://westminsteru.edu/campus-directory/directory-profiles/barnette-kara.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kara Barnette &lt;/a &gt;, who selected our readings.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Royce’s thinking mixes pragmatism with Hegelianism, and we were particularly interested in comparing his idea of community with Hegel’s idea of “geist.” In both cases, a community is something that creates cultural products, and Royce uses customs, languages, and religions as examples of something that was not created by any one individual. Just as we know individual minds by their inputs and outputs, so we know group minds in this way. This is the one place we read where he’s showing his pragmatism… or perhaps behaviorism? Even in the individual case, we understand ourselves not through the momentary experience of consciousness (my current qualia), but based on a socially informed idea of our own history and character. Yes, I have a special relationship with myself (my inner life), but just about everything I can know or say about myself, you could also know or say about me. So it’s not entirely strange to say that we also know about our communities in this relatively externalist, socially and historically grounded way, even as we are part of them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Royce points at psychologist &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-wundt/" target="_blank"&gt;Wilhelm Wundt &lt;/a &gt;whom he describes as comfortable applying psychological analyses to groups. A community will typically be smarter than any individual in it (having access to more total knowledge and skill), but can be as a whole smart or very slow (disorganized), good or evil, cheerful or filled with rage. Royce clearly seems the human telos (social animal) as aimed at joining in such collectivities that can make us feel part of something bigger that ourselves, though he contrasts authentic community with civic society that makes us compete with and resent each other.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So community becomes an ideal. We can see it embodied most clearly in, say, a musical ensemble or sports team, with everyone working together, each aware of the vital role that other members have in creating a sound that would be impossible for the individual alone. And far from these groups being tribal, aimed at hating opponents, Royce argues that this group loyalty naturally engenders a love of loyalty itself, so that you respect other musical groups or sports teams and see yourself as part of that larger music-or-sport-loving community. Ultimately, these authentic communities have within themselves a totalizing telos, so that you aim to see the whole world as united in a common endeavor.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This book is called &lt;em &gt;The Problem of Christianity &lt;/em &gt;because he’s using this idea of an ideal community to describe what Christianity is aiming for: A universal community of believers united in love and fellowship. We didn’t actually read enough of the book to see how he develops this idea, but we got enough to learn that the goal is to create an ideally lovable community that everyone will thus love, but that loving something before it actually exists requires an act of faith, which he claims cannot be understood psychologically, so we have to invoke the concept of grace. He claims that no completely transformative experience, such as Saul of Tarsus turning into St. Paul, can be explained scientifically, because psychological explanations would look at pre-existing personality traits and how these develop deterministically, whereas love comes on like a whirlwind to sweep us up and make us into something new.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Putting aside the weirdness of this Christian ideal community that is supposedly the ultimate outgrowth implied by more basic forms of uniting in communities, how do we come to love and participate in an authentic community? Royce wrote a whole prior book called &lt;em &gt;The Philosophy of Loyalty &lt;/em &gt;(1908) that he’s building on in what we read. For life to be meaningful, we need goals and projects that necessarily involve other people. Per &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2023/11/27/ep330-1-kierkegaard-either-or-aesthetic/" target="_blank"&gt;Kierkegaard’s dismissal of the merely aesthetic life &lt;/a &gt;, we have a need for our actions to feel rooted in connection to others, and not just a few concrete others (your family), but a community that sets standards of responsibility and respectability and evaluates our behavior by them, such that you then conform to those standards like a stable adult instead of a whimsical child.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read volumes &lt;a href="https://ia601307.us.archive.org/19/items/problemofchristi01royciala/problemofchristi01royciala.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;one &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://dn710107.ca.archive.org/0/items/problemchristia05roycgoog/problemchristia05roycgoog.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;two &lt;/a &gt;of the book online.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on "The Certainty and Truth of Reason" in Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;. How can Hegel connect the discovery of self-consciousness with the development of Reason? &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;...By exploring Idealism: Per Fichte, realization of the self is realization of all of reality, because everything is in some sense part of your mind. Reason is how we can think about metaphysically real objects (prior to that point, we have perceptions and synthesize them into objects, but don't make the leap to assigning them a metaphysical status). Can one be an idealist and still allow for the objects of experience to be truly objective?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Marxist_Philosophy/Hegel_and_Feuerbach_files/Hegel-Phenomenology-of-Spirit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, on PDF p. 176 near the bottom, partway through section 233.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Per my announcement at the beginning of this, there's no video for this episode.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-379-egyptian-143184936"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on sources from ancient Egypt, finishing up the instructional literature: " "The Instruction of Ptahhotep," and "The Instruction Addressed to King Merikare," and then we move to the dialogues, ""The Eloquent Peasant," and "The Dispute Between a Man and His Ba."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A theme that runs through the instructions is humility and hence silence: the virtue of self-control. Despite class differences, wisdom might come form any corner, and if you're in a dispute with someone, you can probably stay quiet and let the opponent trip themselves up with their own folly. According to the ancient Egyptian metaphysics, people get what they deserve, so an opponent speaking evilly will invariably fail (in the long run at least).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"The Eloquent Peasant" is likewise an ethical exhortation, except in narrative form. A peasant (Khun-Anup) has been wronged and goes to complain to his magistrate, who is so tickled by the peasant's eloquence that before giving him back the property that was stolen from him, the magistrate makes the peasant continue to complain for several days and writes down these complaints to capture their literary merit. As with the instructions, Khun-Anup's ethical speeches urge the rulers to play straight, bemoaning that what is supposed to be the source of justice and straightness is instead itself a purveyor of crooked injustice. Does the eventual rectification of the initial wrong make the rulers just after all, or does their delay, which drives Khun-Anup to the point of considering suicide, compound the injustice?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we talk briefly about perhaps the most famous of these texts, "The Dispute Between a Man and His Ba," which is a man and his soul debating about whether suicide is morally permissible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Near the end, Chike talks about another text, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipuwer_Papyrus" target="_blank"&gt;Ipuwer &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2025/11/06/closereads-dispute-between-man-and-ba/"&gt;Hear Wes and Mark talk further about the Dispute Between a Man and His Ba &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next episode, we're talking about select chapters within Josiah Royce's &lt;em &gt;The Problem of Christianity &lt;/em &gt;: Look at volumes &lt;a href="https://ia601307.us.archive.org/19/items/problemofchristi01royciala/problemofchristi01royciala.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;one &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://dn710107.ca.archive.org/0/items/problemchristia05roycgoog/problemchristia05roycgoog.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;two &lt;/a &gt;online.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On some of the most famous surviving philosophical works from 2200-1400 BCE: "The Instruction of Ptahhotep," "The Instruction Addressed to King Merikare," "The Great Hymn to the Aten," "The Dispute Between a Man and His Ba," and "The Eloquent Peasant."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Seth are joined by the co-author of the Africana portion of the &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/series/africana-philosophy" target="_blank"&gt;History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast &lt;/a &gt;(and a &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/africana-philosophy-from-ancient-egypt-to-the-nineteenth-century-9780198927174"&gt;new book &lt;/a &gt;based on this). Chike also &lt;a href="https://www.dal.ca/faculty/arts/philosophy/FacultyandStaff/our-faculty/chike-jeffers.html" target="_blank"&gt;teaches at Dalhousie University &lt;/a &gt;in Nova Scotia.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Just as Socrates was responding to the Homeric ethics and the amorality of the gods as depicted in Greek mythology, in "The Great Hymn to the Aten" (our latest text, from the mid-14th century BCE) was an ethical reformer. He was a Pharoah (Nefrititi's husband, King Tut's father) who dictated that Egypt become monotheist, worshipping only the sun (Aten), and in this work he emphasizes not Egypt's superiority, but that all nations, with their various languages and skin colors, are alike under and nourished by the sun.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss the concept of "maat" as it appears in these writings, which metaphorically uses the literal concept of straightness or evenness to characterize an ethical order the permeates the world. So in the instructional texts by royal vizier Ptahhotep to his king (possibly from around 2375-2350 BCE) and the subsequent one by Khety to his son Merikare (from the 21st or 22nd century BCE), we see lots of directives to deal in a forthright and just manner to everyone. These sort of kingly instructions are perhaps most familiar to Western philosophers through Machiavelli; though &lt;em &gt;The Prince &lt;/em &gt;advises rulers to always appear virtuous but to ignore virtue when it's inconvenient, these texts present the kind of traditional view that Machiavelli was subverting. Still, they are not without moral nuance. For example, Ptahhotep advises that strong class divisions, i.e. a rich ruling class, will help ensure that government officials can't be bribed. Khety is particularly harsh on rooting out rebels.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In our second half, we'll talk about the narratives which at least one scholar also attributed to Khety: "The Eloquent Peasant," and "The Dispute Between a Man and His Ba." Mark and Wes take on the latter of these line-by-line in &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/closereads/"&gt;our latest Closereads episode &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We mainly used the translations from Miriam Lichtheim from volumes 1 and 2 of &lt;em &gt;Ancient Egyptian Literature &lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="https://ia601301.us.archive.org/10/items/MiriamLichtheimAncientEgyptianLiteratureVolI/Miriam%20Lichtheim%20Ancient%20Egyptian%20Literature%20Vol%20I.pdf"&gt;Read volume 1 online &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://ia601206.us.archive.org/29/items/MiriamLichtheimAncientEgyptianLiteratureVolII/Miriam%20Lichtheim%20Ancient%20Egyptian%20Literature%20Vol%20II.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;volume 2 &lt;/a &gt;. We also looked at a bit of Maulana Karenga's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routledge.com/Maat-The-Moral-Ideal-in-Ancient-Egypt-A-Study-in-Classical-African-Ethics/Karenga/p/book/9780415649803" target="_blank"&gt;Maat: The Moral Ideal in Ancient Egypt &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2004), which &lt;a href="https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781135937676_A23811847/preview-9781135937676_A23811847.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;you can preview online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can follow Chike's distinctions among the various historical stages in ancient Egypt with this handy &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_ancient_Egypt" target="_blank"&gt;History of Ancient Egypt page &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The relevant episodes in the History of Philosophy podcast are &lt;a href="https://hopwag2.podbean.com/page/18/" target="_blank"&gt;HAP 4-7 &lt;/a &gt;, and Chike's new book based on these with Peter Adamson is &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/africana-philosophy-from-ancient-egypt-to-the-nineteenth-century-9780198927174"&gt;Africana Philosophy from Ancient Egypt to the Nineteenth Century &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this famous, impossibly ancient (ca. 1900 BC!) Egyptian text, a man negotiations with the part of his soul that's supposed to help him in the afterlife. Can he kill himself now and still get all the benefits of an honorable death? His ba says no. Is this actually philosophy, or just a glimpse into the strangeness of a long-gone culture?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 10/23/25. Mark, Wes, and Seth talk about recently dead philosophers and the related issue of how someone (like John Searle) can get un-cancelled.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We announce our future plans to cover more Hegel and Freud, anticipate Josiah Royce, and mention a few other bucket list topics. How should we cover philosophical issues with AI on the show? Relatedly, we talk about a few other podcasts and figures that are talking about this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I can’t even recall what the other “chart” service I checked was, but &lt;a href="https://rephonic.com/charts/apple/united-states/society-culture-philosophy" target="_blank"&gt;here’s one I just found on google &lt;/a &gt;, which as of today puts us at #25 in the philosophy category, well below Very Bad Wizards, though I guess this is dynamic because I swear we were ahead where I checked last week. Want to help drive up our ranking? Go leave us a 5-star rating on Apple Podcasts and send the podcast to a few friends.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we talk about the No Kings protests and being a liberal in Texas.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We’re completing our treatment for now of &lt;em &gt;Thomas Aquinas: Selected Philosophical Writings &lt;/em &gt;, discussion sec. 15, “Feelings.” This recording features Mark, Wes, and Seth. Listen to at least &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/142117602"&gt;part three &lt;/a &gt;first, also about the mind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Passions are defined as passive (“passio” in Latin), and the puzzle again is how to fit the Aristotelian model of the soul (with its passive and active parts) with the Christian doctrine that says the soul is unchanging: It can’t undergo changes as any passive thing does.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The solution seems to be to say that while the soul is unchanging in its essential properties, it can have different incidental properties due to its connection to a body, which can of course be in different locations, can be alive or dead, and can undergo passions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then get a taxonomy of emotions, differentiating them by their being merely affective (feeling love, for instance) or aggressive (e.g. feeling bold), the latter of which means we don’t just feel something but take some action as part of the emotion toward the object, e.g. desire or boldness means we move through obstacles to obtain or fight something.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On another vector some emotions draw us toward an object (love), some away (hatred). Aquinas then asks if all emotions have an opposite, and concludes that most of them do, but anger is the exception due to Aristotle’s theory of anger (discussed in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-144-guest-on-50891615"&gt;ep. 144 &lt;/a &gt;), which is aggressive, but yet doesn’t have any actual work to do, as the thing that makes you angry has already been done.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aquinas’ story about how souls can be immortal (as mentioned near the beginning of this part) is given in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/closereads-and-142428197"&gt;our latest Closereads episode &lt;/a &gt;, which I suppose could be considered part five of ep. 378 if we were so perverse as to present it this way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;From &lt;em &gt;Disputed Questions in De Anima &lt;/em &gt;(1269) as presented in &lt;em &gt;Thomas Aquinas: Selected Philosophical Writings &lt;/em &gt;(Oxford 1993), "Passage 18: Soul in Human Beings." &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The question is how Aquinas, as an Aristotelian who therefore thinks the mind is the form of the body, can agree with the Christian doctrine that the soul exists after death. The answer is surprisingly weird: The body-less soul is incomplete, so we'd need to have the end-of-times full-bodily-resurrection of all the good people in order to have a truly satisfactory heaven.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Aquinas_on_Soul.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're now moving on to the "mind" portion of our discussion, starting with how reason motivates us and hence how free will is possible. This is sections 16, 17, and eventually 12 in &lt;em &gt;Thomas Aquinas: Selected Philosophical Writings &lt;/em &gt;. Listen to parts &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-378-aquinas-141584408"&gt;one &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-378-aquinas-141584408"&gt;two &lt;/a &gt;first.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As with the various causality-related arguments for the existence of God, we're wading into the complicated Aristotelian waters of causality that Aquinas is trying to interpret in a way compatible with Christian doctrine, which requires that we be free agents yet operating under God (who knows our actions in advance and is the ultimate cause of everything).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One might think that something is free if its causality comes primarily from within it. But Aristotle (unlike Plato) says that forms are within things, but if, e.g. a rabbit's DNA causes it to grow and behave in rabbit-like ways, it is still not acting freely, as the rabbit did not invent that form. This is unlike a person deciding to build a house, who may design the house, or even if he doesn't, he's deciding what actions go in what order to carry out the plan. So even if in some sense the person has to have the desire for the house to be built (the desire was implanted by culture, instinct, and/or God), even if the ways of building are restricted by various laws of physics and the person's own biology, the fact that there's flexibility in response means that the action counts as free.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another way of putting this is that all human actions are motivated by some perceived good, but that doesn't mean that these desired goods determine our actions, because as creatures with understanding, we can see beyond the immediate good to the idea of good in general, and we can use this to change our strategy: to resist one good (the cake before me) in favor of some other (health). So this comes down to what's probably a familiar theory for anyone familiar with Aristotle's ethics: Despite our being part of a universal causal system, we can distinguish between simply blindly following an impulse (so eating the cake without reflection is not acting freely), and engaging in rational deliberation that can potentially wrench us from what would otherwise be a goal immediately given by desire.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But Aquinas is interested in bringing in Aristotelian metaphysics and philosophy of mind too, and so he has to describe how will fits into the mind, and how the mind itself is structured (with a passive and active part). Will itself has to be stimulated by something external, and none of us can escape the overall desire for happiness, but once it's been activated, we can consider it self-directing in choosing among options to achieve happiness.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite the free will section occurring earlier in this book than the introduction to mind, we covered that last here (and actually, our supporter-only part four will cover feelings). The question is whether the mind passive (like the passions). It is definitely something that has potential (e.g. the potential to think of something in particular) that is then repeatedly actualized (as we think of that thing), and this is on Aristotelian grounds exactly what it is to be passive. Yet for the account of free will to work there has to be an active part as well: an "agent mind" that is not merely affected as sense organs are, but which can choose, can cause things in the passive part of the mind, such as when you choose to look at (or imagine) one thing rather than another. Aquinas argues that while a sense organ can accept images, the agent mind is necessary to extract forms from them, e.g. to see a rabbit as a rabbit or to see the color green as being a member of a category of other green instances and shades.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We'll talk about ancient Egyptian philosophy as discussed in &lt;a href="https://hopwag2.podbean.com/page/18/" target="_blank"&gt;episodes HAP 4-6 of The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast &lt;/a &gt;(i.e. the beginning of their Africana treatment) with the co-author of that effort, Chike Jeffers.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/141584400"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on bits of &lt;em &gt;Thomas Aquinas: Selected Philosophical Writings &lt;/em &gt;, completing our analysis of his arguments for the existence of God and then turning to eternity and the possibility of actually talking about God.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One theme that runs through all these is the incommensurability between empirical things (which Aquinas says are the things we actually know; he's surprisingly an empiricist) and divine things. So if we only see causality among physical things, how can we conclude that there is some first, infinite cause that is God? He answers that we don't have to understand from the physical evidence the nature of God, e.g. his infinity, but only that there has to be &lt;em &gt;something &lt;/em &gt;that comes first. Maybe this wouldn't be enough by itself to establish God, but he couples this with arguments from necessity (if everything were merely contingent, i.e. might not be, that at some point there would have been nothing; so we need something that is necessary to ground all contingent things) and from design (the world looks designed, therefore someone must have designed it), etc., such that the combined implications of these arguments is that there's one unchangeable, necessary, self-causing designer, which we might as well call God.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Likewise for eternity: He insists that even though time is something that is cut up into moments, eternity is simple and whole (no parts), so counter-intuitively, eternity isn't just a name for "all time," but must itself be outside time. I claim that the only reason you'd have this weird idea about eternity being simple is because you're already committed to God being simple.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our final question has to do with that simplicity. Christians want to say that God is good, exists, loves us, is all-powerful, all-knowing, etc., but if God is perfectly simple, necessary, and unchanging, then He has no contingent properties. His various qualities have to literally BE his essence. So when we finite beings try to pick Him out using these various attributes, we're engaging with a certain kind of illusion: Picking out God via his visible effects (e.g. the good things he created which point us to his being the source of all goodness). Not being infinite ourselves, we can't really know God in His essence; He's just too big compared to us. But nonetheless, Aquinas argues that we're not committed to being negative theologists a la &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-101-on-god-33200446"&gt;Maimonides &lt;/a &gt;; we can say He truly is good, exists, etc., though when we say He loves us or holds us in His loving arms, we're just engaged in metaphor.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the third part of this discussion (featuring all four of us but recorded a couple of days later), we'll finish the metaphysical story here by bringing in the human mind and free will, and then you supporters will get a bonus recording where three of us finish up our assigned reading by dwelling on human emotions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On selections from &lt;em &gt;Thomas Aquinas: Selected Philosophical Writings &lt;/em &gt;, mostly taken from the &lt;em &gt;Summa Theologica &lt;/em &gt;(1268). Featuring Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Given our flawed, finite human nature, how do we fit into the universe? In particular, how can we know and talk about things far beyond our experience such as God and eternity? Or maybe we just can't?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aquinas is writing within a tradition where appeal to authority is paramount. Not that this substitutes for thinking, because authorities disagree. Each selection in our reading considers a different question and quotes authorities on both sides of the issue, always leading with the strongest argument he can find for the position he will ultimately be against.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We started out with Sec. 20 in our book, "There Exists a God," which first asks whether an argument for God is even necessary; perhaps it's self-evident? (Aquinas ultimately thinks not.) Second, is a proof available? (He says yes.) Finally, he gives the proofs themselves, which we had previously discussed in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-43-arguments-15463020"&gt;ep. 43 &lt;/a &gt;(on J.L. Mackie).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This recording will have three public parts: We finish up God and eternity in part two, and then in part three talk about free will and mind. In the supporter-exclusive part four, we'll discuss Aquinas' view of feelings. At the beginning of this episode we talk about our plans to further discuss his views of ethics and law, but we've decided to push that to ep. 381 after Dylan's return from Europe.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/selected-philosophical-writings-9780199540273" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the reading &lt;/a &gt;, which was compiled by Timothy McDermott in 1993, or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/selectedphilosop0000thom"&gt;try it out online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Leviathan &lt;/em &gt;(1651), ch. 21, "On the Liberty of Subjects." Thomas Hobbes is known for defending absolute monarchy, so as you'd predict, he's not going to say we have a lot of "natural" liberties. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We do always have the right to self-defense, but that doesn't mean that the sovereign can't with complete justice command you executed (even if you're innocent). Yet Hobbes wants to say that even under a repressive regime we all have lots of liberty, in the sense of no one physically stopping us from doing what we will. And he wants to dismiss as unintelligible any other sense of liberty tied to non-physical obstacles, so this entirely rules out any debate about free will.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://dn790001.ca.archive.org/0/items/hobbessleviathan00hobbuoft/hobbessleviathan00hobbuoft.pdf"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;: starting on p. 161 (PDF p. 197).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

What is it that humans are inevitably trying to avoid that seems so bad to us? It's our existential separation from others, our essential, incommunicable solitude.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We further discuss why Cioran praises sloth and ennui. Most likely, post-WWII he was very skeptical of "great projects" that can slide into violence. Relatedly, we also talk about time and nostalgia; we have irrational desires for things to be different than they are that pull us out of time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, what is it to be a "traitor to existence," and is this good? He talks about The Buddha in this context: someone whose life was actually changed by something he saw (illness, old age, death) and who after rejecting desire and other worldly things ultimately rejected even salvation (escape from the cycle of rebirth) so can could come back and be a teacher.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next episode: We're discussing Thomas Aquinas on our knowledge of God from the Summa Theologica as presented in  Oxford’s &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/selected-philosophical-writings-9780199540273" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Aquinas: Selected Philosophical Writings &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, compiled by Timothy McDermott in 1993.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;A Short History of Decay &lt;/em &gt;(1949), a pessimist/existentialist text from the most famous Romanian philosopher consisting of short, multi-paragraph, relatively independent sections. It’s aphoristic a la much of Nietzsche, but not of the one-liner variety. If you’re a fan of Nietzsche, Cioran (pronounced “cho-RAHN”) delivers similar scorching wit, but is harder to pin down in terms of what he’s actually recommending. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Like Camus and other existentialists, Cioran sees the human condition as a kind of fallenness: We inevitably avert our eyes from the human condition, scurrying into various socially suggested activities that distract us from the meaninglessness of our lives. But whereas the existentialists hold before us some sort of ideal of authenticity to be attained if we hold the line and avoid such distractions, Cioran claims that facing the truth about ourselves is simply unbearable. Life is suffering, and there is no point to doing anything.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The book is lengthy, and even the first essay, “Directions for Decomposition,” is 90 pages, which was too much for us, so our discussion is just based on the first 60 pages of that. There’s no apparent organization among the various sections within that, and we’re sure that we didn’t miss out on any grand conclusion from the end of the essay. But he does have a few themes that he keeps circling back to, and he turns his pessimistic world-view on a variety of topics for thought, including art, humor, God, salvation, time, nostalgia, mourning, death, disease, suicide, revolt, freedom, Buddhism, Daoism, and the role of the philosopher.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Cioran, everything is vanity (see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-362-biblical-123488363"&gt;Ecclesiastes &lt;/a &gt;!), but we pretend it’s not. We cannot avoid hope. A thoroughgoing nihilist (or skeptic, as he often puts it) is a practical impossibility.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But if he doesn’t have positive recommendations for action, there are at least some actions he condemns more than others: Fanaticism is of course horrible (he was writing in light of the recent Nazi experience), and he claims that any kind of faith puts one on the road to fanaticism. So by contrast, he praises sloth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Solitude at least keeps one free of some of the distractions to contemplating your own nature, while speech is a sure way to falsify that nature by trying to change the ineffable into something flat and public. (Philosophers do this!) He claims that artists at least are not living a total lie, as they try to express that ineffable without destroying it. He values individuality, and actually praises disease as something that makes us hyper-focused on ourselves: Suffering disease is an “occupation” which does not distract from the awful truths of life, but instead which is a direct experience of those truths. But this is of course hardly a fate that anyone could wish on themselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Cioran’s “recommendations” tend to be merely the less worse of bad options, and more often he just comments on these options without telling us which is to be pursued; no doubt he sees this as up to one’s individual taste, and he says that no one is really in a position to judge others (though of course we constantly do). For example, being an artist seems a good way to cope, but Cioran describes it as a valve by which artists keep the human condition from building up. By contrast, someone without artistic talent can become in some way a greater person, with more force of will, ready to explode in a fantastically tragic fashion. We would invariably choose the first of these options, but there is something admirable (or at least impressive) about the second.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Rather than put forth an attainable ideal, Cioran occasionally talks about how we “could dream of” some better way to be. In this sense he sounds like a Beauvoir’s definition of a nihilist: A disappointed idealist. He remembers some sort of ideals he used to have, and he talks about not being able to dispel Hope from consciousness, but these will clearly not be achieved. One might hope to be a thoroughgoing skeptic or cynic, or someone able to be satisfied just gazing honestly into the void (so some kind of Buddhist sage), but these are at least not goals he seriously thinks he can achieve.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Decay-M-Cioran/dp/161145736X" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://dokumen.pub/short-history-of-decay-9780141192727.html" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Starting in Book 4, Plato's characters are discussing how to create a new state ("Magnesia") from scratch. What sorts of laws should it have?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss the marriage laws and whether Plato's presentation of this topic actually fulfills his requirement that laws have a rationally argued prelude for the law.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plato also argues that there should be a law about believing in the gods, so that you'll then be law-abiding. (This interestingly seems to conflict with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/11/16/ep46-plato-euthyphro-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;his argument in &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/11/16/ep46-plato-euthyphro-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Euthyphro &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;/em &gt;that ethics does not rely on religion.) He gives an argument for the existence of gods that he thinks everyone can accept in saying that mind (form) must always precede matter. Soul (psyche) is just defined as that which has motion in itself, and clearly, Plato argues, there must be such a self-moving motion before the passive things that only move when pushed. So it's a variation off of the cosmological argument (there must be a first mover), but has intervening steps.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about Plato's ruling body ("the nocturnal council"), why varying virtues are all actually virtue, punishments, and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're talking about the beginning of Emil Cioran's &lt;em &gt;A Brief History of Decay &lt;/em &gt;(1947).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Everybody reads &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/07/11/ep40-plato-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Plato’s &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/07/11/ep40-plato-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Republic &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, but is that dialogue really a political philosophy text (like the ideal type of government proposed there is what he really thinks we should and perhaps can have), or is he just using the political to illustrate something about the personal virtue of justice, as Socrates explicitly says in the dialogue?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Well, in this later (and longer, and much less popular) dialogue (from 347 BCE at the latest), we get a pretty straightforward question of what the purpose of government is, what a real-world government’s laws should look like, and how they should be established and adjusted as time goes on.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These doctrines do not come from the mouth of Socrates, but from an unnamed Athenian (some commentators claim it’s supposed to be Plato himself) on a long walk (mirroring the supposed walk that the Cretan founder Minos took to Zeus’ temple; supposedly Zeus helped him come up with the laws for the state) with a Cretan and a Spartan. While these other fellows start with the claim that the main purpose of a state is to make its citizenry fit to defend the country in case of war, the Athenian claims that it is to make its citizens virtuous, which is the same as thriving (eudaimonia). So they are not to be controlled, e.g. with a Noble Lie a la &lt;em &gt;The Republic &lt;/em &gt;, but each law will in fact come with a persuasive prelude explaining why the law is necessary, and all citizens (not just an elite class of guardians) should be educated to be able to understand and obey reasonable laws.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While training people to resist fear (making them good soldiers) is part of being virtuous, they should also be trained on how to resist pleasure, and one can do this by exposing them to this through parties, letting people see if they can drink, but not to excess, and not to then do regrettable things. Like &lt;em &gt;The Republic &lt;/em &gt;, there’s a lot in here about education, which should teach a perfect citizen how to rule and be ruled with justice. As with &lt;em &gt;The Republic &lt;/em &gt;, part of this involves allowing poets to only teach moral lessons.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though a real state can have no measures as radical as pulling children from parents into a general pool, Plato’s recommendations might look to us as quite totalitarian: All citizens are required to believe in the gods (again, he thinks they can reasonably be convinced of this, but if they can’t out they go), there doesn’t seem to be any limits about how much the laws can involve themselves with family life and employment, and punishments can be very harsh (for the “irredeemable,” Plato judges that death would be better for them than living no virtue). A good state won’t have its citizens covering in fear of the government, though, because the educational system would be all geared toward training good citizens. Punishments would be rare, and always designed to further improve people. Also, the Greek term for law (Nomos), refers to social conventions too. And of course we have customs about family and personal life.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A key analogy in the text that makes this less authoritarian is the difference between a slave doctor and a free doctor. A slave doctor (one who treats slaves, and is probably himself a slave… a more modern image might be a veterinarian) just delivers the treatment with no explanation, according to habit and training. A free doctor on Plato’s description understands the science of why a treatment works, and explains this to his free patients, who can agree or not to undergo the recommended treatments. So the latter is ideally what the relation between the rulers and the citizens are: The laws are rationally created to maximize flourishing, and these are explained to citizens who want to flourish and who have been educated to be able to understand the good arguments why they should cause flourishing. Finally, Plato recommends a “nocturnal council” that combines wise elders with young people who are gauging conditions on the ground, so if there are laws that aren’t in fact functioning to bring about flourishing, then this group can change such laws.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/platos-laws-pangle" target="_blank"&gt;Read the 1979 Thomas Pangle translation that we read &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 9/7/25, featuring Mark, Seth, and Dylan. We re-litigate the utility of Irigaray's feminist insights and relate this to the overall contrast between political and philosophical argumentation: One can approve of the political upshot of an argument without finding it philosophically interesting.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If one is ready to grant entirely the practical point that women should be encouraged and accepted as philosophical writers (and main figures in popular narratives, political leaders, etc.), and that in general a greater diversity of voices will yield a greater diversity of philosophical visions (which is good), is the rest of Irigaray merely an interesting literary exercise, or is there some real meat there that will change the way you think about metaphysics, epistemology, etc.?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Second, Dylan and Seth say more about Steven Pinker in light of his near absence in the Lincoln et al. episode despite the fact that he was on the reading list. We are right now reading Emil Cioran, who will provide some pessimism to answer Pinker's optimism. This leads of course to some discussion (and a fiery rant by Dylan) about current politics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/has-america-lost-its-appetite-for-the-common-good/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the Freakonomics interview with Deneen that Seth mentions &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;, section 198-201 in the section, "Stoicism, Scepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness." We finally get to talking about Stoicism and not just about attaining a thick self, but Stoicism is not described in a way that Stoics would be very happy with: It's just a deficient moment in thinking about what your self is: It's something that's fundamentally unmoored from your world such that no values (or ultimately facts, though that's going to be the main issue in the next section on Skepticism) impinge on you. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Per actual Stoic doctrine, "bad" things might seem to happen out in the world, but they're not really bad &lt;em &gt;for you &lt;/em &gt;unless you decide that they are. This is not to say that values are subjective/relative, because a Stoic will say that there is a thing called objective virtue that they are pursuing (which involves asserting this freedom from your environment), but insofar as there are alleged values of things outside of your own will, then these things are not really values at all; &lt;em &gt;they have nothing to do with you &lt;/em &gt;(Epictetus).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hegel's position can be seen as a flavor of Wittgenstein's private language argument (e.g. see Koorsgard bringing this to bear in our recent discussions of her ethics): Values involve something fundamentally public, something that implicates your engagement in a cooperative project of evaluation with other people. Hegel will go on to describe ethics as a "geist" (translation: spirit): as a cultural phenomenon, not primarily and individual one. Pretending that other people's judgments simply "have nothing to do with you" is just delusion, though it is a dialectical advance over having your entire self determined by someone else's judgments (as the slave's is by the master's).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Hegel-Phenomenology-Stocism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Follow along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Women on the Market" from &lt;em &gt;The Sex Which Is Not One &lt;/em &gt;(1977) and other selections, continuing with guest Jenny Hansen from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/138216224"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"Women on the Market" is a study and application of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-360-karl-marx-121368447"&gt;Marx's theory of commodities from the first chapter of &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-360-karl-marx-121368447"&gt;Das Kapital &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. Just as for Marx, a commodity's value is abstracted from how useful it is to a market value, for Irigaray, a woman's intrinsic worth is ignored in favor of men's valuation of them. They are literally converted to a product that men will find attractive, and the trading off women between families as daughters are married off is the unacknowledged foundation of male society. She calls this relation of man to man through the mediation of women-as-commodities "hom(m)o-sexuality," in that "homme" is French for "man," and this is a strictly man-man relationship with women there only as objects to be traded.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;It's difficult again to know how literally to take this, or even how well the metaphor with Marx works. For Marx, there's something natural about use value (how useful is this coat?) that is lost when we move to market value, which Marx sees as representing a social standard of average labor that went into the thing. So if you make coats slowly, that doesn't make your coat more valuable, and if your coat is more comfortable than another's, it's still more valuable only insofar as this can translate to market value (there are lots of reasons why some cheaper commodity might actually be better, at least for your individual purposes). For women, there's no comparable "man's labor" that goes into converting the women, such that the value of the woman is ultimately attributable to that labor. In fact, it's the natural "use-value" of women that should be at issue in treating women like objects for sex and reproduction. And while certainly the incest taboo requires that women (and men) not marry within the family, the frequency of "trading women" between clans as being foundational for politics, as with rich and/or royal families you've seen on TV, is pretty low among couplings overall, and such practices as getting the father's permission, dowries, etc. have been clearly on the decline for a long time. Jenny brings up trophy wives and Jeffrey Epstein to make this modern.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We eventually connect this to our final reading selection, "Body Against Body: In Relation to the Mother" (1993), which sets some limit to the trading of women, in that mothers are sacrosanct; we don't trade them and we don't treat them as sexual. In fact, Irigaray claims that Western intellectualism is profoundly uncomfortable with motherly sexuality because we want to deny our biological origins and just see ourselves as rational beings. In clinging to rationality, men project the irrational onto women, which then leads to misogyny and alienation of all concerned. Man's public life is hom(m)o-sexual and rational, whereas our fears and discomfort are relegated to hearth and home as represented by and embodied in women.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk a bit about the most positive of these essays, which is an excerpt from &lt;em &gt;An Ethics of Sexual Difference &lt;/em &gt;(1984), where she describes the role of wonder as an alternative to mechanistic objectification. We should regard our partners as fundamentally mysterious (wonderful) rather than predictable and hence boring. The essay still gets very flowery and metaphysical; we briefly discuss her comments on angels as stand-ins for that relationship between human and divine which we should get out of sex but don't.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the remaining essay, "Sexes and Genealogies: Each Sex Must Have Its Own Rights" (1993), there's an analysis of Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology &lt;/em &gt;about the family as the foundation of society, and how (per &lt;em &gt;Antigone &lt;/em &gt;, which the &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology &lt;/em &gt;discusses in this context) woman as representative of home values (family as opposed to society) gets shafted.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The book Jenny recommends at the end is Genevieve Lloyd's &lt;em &gt;The Man of Reason: Male and Female in Western Philosophy &lt;/em &gt;(1984).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading Plato's dialogue &lt;em &gt;The Laws &lt;/em &gt;, specifically &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/platos-laws-pangle" target="_blank"&gt;the Thomas Pangle translation &lt;/a &gt;(1980): Books 1 (624a-632d, 643d-645c), 2 (652a-653c, 660e), 4 (716c-724b), 5 (727a-734e), 9 (853a-859d, 86d-864e), 10 (886a-897b), and 12 (961b-969d).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On selections (1977-1993) by Irigaray as presented in the &lt;em &gt;French Feminism Reader &lt;/em &gt;(2000), ed. Kelly Oliver. Returning guest &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/tag/jennifer-hansen/" target="_blank"&gt;Jenny Hansen &lt;/a &gt;joins Mark, Seth, and Dylan to discuss the introduction she wrote in this book, plus parts of Irigaray’s &lt;em &gt;The Sex Which Is Not One &lt;/em &gt;(1977) and to a lesser degree &lt;em &gt;An Ethics of Sexual Difference &lt;/em &gt;(1984), “Sexes and Genealogies: Each Sex Must Have Its Own Rights” (1993), and “Body Against Body: In Relation to the Mother” (1993).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What role should sexual difference play in philosophy and society? Irigaray is a “second-wave” feminist: First-wave ones just stress that we should treat women equally; third-wave ones (e.g. Judith Butler) think we should radically rethink or even discard notions of gender. Second-wave feminists instead stress sexual difference, in that justice demands that we do treat women differently because they have different needs than men: For instance, job structures need to take pregnancy into account.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Irigaray is more concerned with the intellectual and emotional contributions that she claims femininity can specifically make. Since nearly all historical philosophy was constructed by men, it incorporates a male point of view that has in effect “de-subjectivized” women: Women are never the thinkers, never the first-person point of view doing the phenomenological evaluation of experience. So when they are able to do philosophy, they have to articulate themselves by aping the male philosophers, expressing themselves through conceptual tools that are foreign to their femininity. Irigaray was trained in psychoanalysis and is making use of Jacques Lacan’s distinction between language as the “name of the father” and “the real,” which is all that slips between the cracks of our conceptual distinctions. What would be uniquely feminine in its expression is inexpressible in male-constructed language, so it’s up to creative women to innovate artistically to devise new forms of expression.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does one use language to transcend language? Well, you can use the male language in a mocking, deconstructive way. So she plays with the format of delivering philosophy in a manner reminiscent of Nietzsche’s irreverence. Unlike Christine Korsgaard, who (per the method of analytic philosophy) tries to lay out her arguments as clearly as possible, Irigaray often tries to jar us out of traditional ways of thinking through purposefully inflammatory language. However, she shifts her style to meet the purpose of the moment, and she just as often is soliciting male cooperation: Won’t love and sex be better, fellas, if you treat your lady as a full subject with a point of view, and not as just an object to reflect back on yourself?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-42-feminists-15462982"&gt;our very first feminism episode &lt;/a &gt;(from 2011), Carol Gilligan explained how a feminine point of view can improve our notions: Away from seeing impartiality (per Kant and utilitarianism) as the goal and towards and ethics of care (see our recent episodes on sympathy/empathy). More recently, we discussed &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-293-donna-on-66167271"&gt;Donna Haraway’s feminist philosophy of science &lt;/a &gt;, where she questioned the notion of scientific objectivity and the overall “master mentality,” i.e. the controlling character of science, which she thought influenced what we consider legitimate scientific questions, methods, and goals.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Irigaray’s most concrete contribution to this strain is in the final selection, where she argues to a group of psychoanalysts that Freud’s models of development do not do justice to women’s experiences and wrongly point us away from investigation of our uncomfortable relationship to our biological (i.e. maternal) origins. Though Irigaray also tells us (e.g. in the first essay) that the feminine can cause us to completely redefine the project of philosophy, she is here more inspirational/aspirational than demonstrative. It is unclear what a new ground a specifically feminine perspective can open up that was unavailable to male innovators like Nietzsche, Lacan, Derrida, Foucault, Whitehead, Buddhist and Daoist thinkers, etc. Toward the end of this first part of our discussion, we do get into her cheeky metaphor that male-dominated philosophy uses a mirror to reflect on itself (i.e. not challenge fundamental historical assumptions), whereas feminists can add the speculum, which as curved doesn’t just reflect back the investigator but allows a survey of the surrounding (cultural, introspective, biological) environment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is related to a criticism often aimed at second-wave feminists re. essentialism: It was the point of first-wave feminism that the entire vista of human experience is open to everyone equally. It’s not just men who think they can connect with those of foreign dispositions through literature, art, conversation, and imagination, but this is in fact open to anyone: Women are not “aping” male philosophers any more than male philosophers are simply imitating each other. The distance between any two human beings is greater than the distance between “male” and “female,” and so one should be equally pessimistic about men understanding other men or women understanding other women than the sexes understanding each other. It’s not that women are from Venus and men are from Mars; we are all from our own individual planets, or alternatively, we’re all from the same planet facing the same basic, human challenges even while in unique circumstances. This is also why third-wave feminists might want to simply get rid of the notion of gender; this bifurcation simply can’t do justice to the diversity among us, even in the area of sexually-related self-expression.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Still, there are certainly ways to argue for the unique experiences and needs common to many women having been unfairly marginalized by the male-dominated intellectual cultures of the past, such that women should feel fully empowered to do innovative, creative work even when their instincts fly in the face of institutional norms, and Irigaray is a skillful rhetorician in this area. In addition to taking straightforwardly political lessons from works like this (e.g. don’t assume by default that a philosopher or just about any other role is a man), we should certainly question whether metaphysical and methodological assumptions we make in philosophy and social sciences have been covertly conditioned by gender norms (she mentions our traditional work-week and patterns of endeavor more generally as being shaped according to male libidinal patterns of tension and release in particular, a reference that I found frankly baffling), just as we should question whether these have been conditioned by our economic status (per Marx), religious assumptions (per Nietzsche), by our unconscious desires (per Freud), or other aspects of our cultural and psychological situation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Irigaray-ch.-from-French-Feminism-Reader.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the text for yourself &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/French-Feminism-Reader-Kelly-Oliver/dp/0847697673" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/French-Feminism-Reader-Kelly-Oliver/dp/0847697673" target="_blank"&gt;French Feminism Reader &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;that contains it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing the section on Stoicism in Hegel's "Phenomenology of Spirit," which is under "Freedom of Self-Consciousness," "Stoicism, Scepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness." &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This comes right after his famous lordship and bondage chapter, and explains how in reaction to being defined by the gaze of another person, we assert our independence, but in an immature and ultimately unsustainable way. So this is not a very charitable take on Stoicism; he's just focusing on this assertion of freedom that's at the heart of the philosophy, and you can think yourself about the degree to which this pollutes more thoughtful, developed versions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Hegel-Phenomenology-Stocism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Follow along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as ad-free &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/138067592"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on the dangers to liberal democracy, including consideration of Patrick Deneen, Francis Fukuyama, and Steven Pinker.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/137104153"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;our discussion of the dangers to and weak points of liberal democracy, including consideration of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Liberalism_Failed" target="_blank"&gt;Patrick Deneen’s &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Liberalism_Failed" target="_blank"&gt;Why Liberalism Failed &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2018) and Francis Fukuyama’s “Liberalism and Its Discontents” (his &lt;a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/liberalism-and-its-discontent" target="_blank"&gt;2020 essay &lt;/a &gt;). We also read part of &lt;a href="https://stevenpinker.com/publications/enlightenment-now-case-reason-science-humanism-and-progress" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Pinker’s &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://stevenpinker.com/publications/enlightenment-now-case-reason-science-humanism-and-progress" target="_blank"&gt;Enlightenment Now &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2018).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is liberal democracy founded on people's virtue (as Lincoln stated), or must any effective government assume people's lack of virtue and guard against/channel that? Deneen argues that we need to return to "pre-liberal" focus on virtue, that liberal democracy loosens social bonds. He would prefer a society that unabashedly advocates a particular model of virtue over a Rawlsian "do what ever you want" ethos that undermines virtue.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Fukuyama's paper follows up on this by calling our attention (as he did &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-209-on-24613650"&gt;when we spoke with him)&lt;/a &gt;to thymos, i.e. the spirited part of the soul that demands recognition of status and plays a key role in identity politics. This is a threat to liberal democracy, which in its Rawlsian form demands that the government be neutral with regard to favoring the values (and hence status) of particular groups (e.g. Christian nationalists, but also oppressed identity groups). Still, Fukuyama thinks that liberal democracy is the best system available, so he is not making a case against it as Deneen does.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We don't spend much time on Pinker, who claims that liberalism has achieved great progress, and there's no real problem with it. Seth accuses him here of being blind to history, which invariably involves regressions from the kind of progress Pinker proudly points out for us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading Ch. 7 of the &lt;em &gt;French Feminism Reader &lt;/em &gt;(2000, ed.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What’s the crisis of liberal democracy? Dylan, Wes and Seth are joined by new St. John’s College President &lt;a href="https://www.sjc.edu/about/leadership/santa-fe-president" target="_blank"&gt;J. Walter Sterling &lt;/a &gt;to discuss Abraham Lincoln’s “&lt;a href="https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm" target="_blank"&gt;On the Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions &lt;/a &gt;” (1838) plus the beginnings of &lt;a href="https://stevenpinker.com/publications/enlightenment-now-case-reason-science-humanism-and-progress" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Pinker’s &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://stevenpinker.com/publications/enlightenment-now-case-reason-science-humanism-and-progress" target="_blank"&gt;Enlightenment Now &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2018), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Liberalism_Failed" target="_blank"&gt;Patrick Deneen’s &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Liberalism_Failed" target="_blank"&gt;Why Liberalism Failed &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2018), and Francis Fukuyama’s “Liberalism and Its Discontents” (his &lt;a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/liberalism-and-its-discontent" target="_blank"&gt;2020 essay &lt;/a &gt;, not his 2022 book by that name).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our inclusion of Lincoln demonstrates that this debate over the fundamental adequacy of our form of government to meet our needs is not new; there are always social forces working against the idea that openness and participation will produce just political outcomes. (This was of course why Plato, Aristotle, and many other figures of the past were against democracy; why would one expect the majority to know and support what is best for a whole political community?) Lincoln warns against “mobocracy” demonstrated in lynchings, which were of course against the law.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is a form of government that affords maximum freedom the most durable? We need to revere freedom, to be dedicated to protecting liberty, and what ensures that this reverence will be passed on to the next generation? Foreign influence and internal government corruption can undermine this ideal. Lincoln is worried about human nature too: envy and ambition can overwhelm principle. When the nation was being founded, all of our hatred could be pointed at the British, but in a time of peace, we are liable to turn on each other. How do we react when we think some of our laws are bad? Not everyone has faith in the democratic process (and the inevitability of moral progress more generally) to eventually lead to the outcomes that they consider just, so there will be political pressure to overleap our ineffective institutions and have a strongman fix everything or otherwise overthrow the current system. Lincoln argued that reason (imparted via a liberal education) and respect for the rule of law provide guardrails against all these dangers to the system.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Paradoxically, respect for law and reverence for freedom are not optional, freely chosen values in a stable state: Through education, we need to impress these values on children before their critical faculties have developed enough to freely accept these values. For adults, it’s important for freedom that people be allowed to advocate the abandonment of freedom, but we can’t let such views win out.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The response (represented here by Patrick Deneen, though similar things have been argued by Nietzsche, Leo Strauss, Michael Sandel, and others, claims that pure liberalism is against human nature, which is more communitarian than individualistic, and so was bound to fail. People do not want a fragmented society where people just do what they like; they want a society to support their values. They want to be empowered: to be free in the positive sense of able to live in an environment and lifestyle of their collective choosing, typically in accordance with custom, religion, etc., but this could also be in accordance with the best science. The positive way of putting this is that true freedom is life in accordance with virtue, which is different than freedom from cultural norms.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Read Lincoln’s speech online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We are concluding our treatment of Peter Railton's "Moral Realism" (1984), and given that you likely haven't listened to the seven preceding parts, or (like us) you've forgotten things from them, this discussion can serve as a standalone summary of not only Railton's view, but of our efforts to actually figure out what a plausible naturalistic, empirical account of ethics could amount to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The first part of the paper is concerned with setting up the idea that individuals have objective interests, and that we can know something about these by imagining what we as individuals would choose if we had all the relevant information about ourselves and our situation. Because you with knowledge of physiology and the poisonous quality of various drinks would &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;choose to drink what is in fact poisonous, this shows that it is in your objective interest &lt;em &gt;right now &lt;/em &gt;to not drink that poison, even if you don't know that it's poison and you really really desire it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He then shifts to comparably saying that for societies, there is likewise such a thing as health, such that, for example, slavery is unhealthy and unstable: A society whose leaders knew all the relevant details about long-term stability would not choose a body politic with such an unhealthy characteristic.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the question is, can he bring these two accounts together such that the wise, all-knowing version of you as an individual would choose not only what is in your individual objective self-interest, but you would also choose what would make you a good citizen of a healthy community. For the result to be full-on ethics, this would have to generalize not only to identification of your interest with that of your social group, but with all of humanity, and really all of creation (to allow for environmental responsibilities, for example). While Railton does not argue very much explicitly for this leap (he merely points out the intuitive plausibility that a mature person &lt;em &gt;would &lt;/em &gt;so identify), we talk through how Hume, Kant, and Korsgaard handled this question, and whether their insights can complete Railton's account.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.filosoficas.unam.mx/docs/1110/files/Railton%20Moral%20realism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on PDF p. 42.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/137009154"&gt;Watch the video &lt;/a &gt;, if you'd prefer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're still talking about social rationality, and we eventually skip a bit because we don't need to be convinced that systematic mistreatment of portions of the population will cause a society to be less stable. Railton seems to think that an objective "social good" needs to be argued for, given that history does not always drift toward such good. Likewise, there is scientific truth, even though scientists to not always progress toward this (though they tend to).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.filosoficas.unam.mx/docs/1110/files/Railton%20Moral%20realism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on PDF p. 31.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We are going to do one more on this reading to wrap it up and not have to rush through our actual conclusions.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/136046819"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;Just and Unjust Wars &lt;/em &gt;(1977), ch. 5-6.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ch. 5, "Anticipations" discusses times when it might be morally permissible to strike first, even when no immanent incoming attack is anticipated. These cases will be rare, and depending on what counts as a credible ongoing threat. If war is inevitable, and not attacking first would result in disaster, then this is permissible. He gives the example of Israel's 1967 six-day war, where on his analysis Egypt had gathered its forces on the border and engaged in economic embargo, which over time would have been untenable for Israel, so they were justified in firing the first shots. Incidentally, Walzer &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/the-just-war-of-the-ukrainians-11648214810" target="_blank"&gt;is on record &lt;/a &gt;in arguing that Russia's invasion was on the contrary obviously unjust; the abstract threat of Ukraine's potentially joining NATO and so destabilizing the balance of power in the region in favor of the West is exactly the kind of 18th century reasoning he is arguing against in this book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Putin also claims to be invading in order to save Russians in parts of Ukraine from being mistreated, and Walzer does allow for interventions on humanitarian grounds, but again, the reasoning for this sort of interference has to be iron-clad, e.g. an obvious genocide a la Rwanda (and incidentally, &lt;a href="https://fathomjournal.org/the-wars-in-lebanon-and-gaza-an-interview-with-michael-walzer/" target="_blank"&gt;Walzer has argued as of November 2024 that Israel is not committing genocide &lt;/a &gt;, though I don't know what is view is of the current situation), and Russia's claims of this sort do not hold water.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There are several issues here that Walzer addresses in Ch. 6 on Interventions: First, within a country, even if there is repressive leadership, other countries are not justified in invading for the purpose of "liberating" the country (the reasoning comes originally from Mill): Nations have to navigate their own way toward freedom in order to be in a state where it will persist. This explains why Afghanistan did not stay free after America's departure. Russia's thinking that Ukraine's government is corrupt is not by itself a reason for invasion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Likewise, if a nation is engaged in civil war, other nations ought to stay out of it, except insofar as some other nation has already entered on one side; in this case, nations might get involved to counter the foreign influence. This could obviously escalate, and so is something to be cautious about, but is not in itself unjust.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what counts as "a nation?" Territorial disputes often revolve around some region between nations, and Putin claims that some parts of Ukraine are ethnically Russian and should be part of Russia. For Walzer, this could not be something that Russia could unilaterally decide, but should be a matter of the self-determination of the population of the areas at issue. Still, even if such an area should want to secede (whether to become independent or join another state) and start a civil war over it, Walzer advises that other nations stay out of it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Relatedly, it's also very hard for outsiders to get accurate information about what's going on in a region, what the populace actually thinks, and this is a good reason for staying out of it as a general rule.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Remember, though, that all this discussion is only about when it is justified to go to war, and not about what counts as just conduct within war (which is covered by the second half of the book, which we did not read). So the question of whether Israel is justified in defending itself is separate from whether its methods of war are ethical. (Clearly Hamas' methods of protecting its fighters by embedding them in civilian populations and seeking to prevent any aid from reaching its people that does not come from Hamas is unethical on Walzer's grounds, but so is any action by Israel that does not seek to minimize civilian casualties.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Differences in people's assessment about the facts here frustrate our ability to straightforwardly apply philosophical theory to practice. Walzer can argue that in such and such circumstances, war is justified or not, but even in presenting his historical examples (he spends a lot of time talking about our unjust intervention in Vietnam), he understands that different historians and other observers may have different characterizations of events, such that he encourages readers to just consider them as hypothetical situations: If country X acted in such-and-such ways, that would be unjust. But has Russia, or Israel, or the United States, in fact acted in these ways? Walzer clearly has his opinions and thinks these to be justified, but we should not let differences about facts distort our widespread, basic agreement (Walzer claims) about the moral principles involved.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;Walter Sterling, the new president of St. John's College, will join us to talk about liberty via Abraham Lincoln's 1838 speech "On the Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions," plus bits from Steven Pinker (&lt;em &gt;Enlightenment Now &lt;/em &gt;), Patrick Deneen (&lt;em &gt;Why Liberalism Failed &lt;/em &gt;), and Francis Fukuyama (&lt;em &gt;Liberalism and Its Discontents &lt;/em &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument With Illustrations &lt;/em &gt;(1977, updated in 2006), ch. 4-6 on "jus ad bellum," which refers to moral justifications for going to war, as opposed to "jus in bello," which refers to how war is conducted. Featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The short answer is that self-defense is OK, while aggression is not. But of course, this can be difficult to discern in real circumstances: Is Israel just defending itself, or is it going beyond that to aggressively take land? Many aggressors use past wrongs as justification, but Walzer says that is not relevant: Even if Israel or the U.S. or whoever stole its land in the first place, a population living in a place has a right to self-determination, to have its borders respected, even if these borders were formed in an arbitrary way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This idea compares nations to individuals, acknowledging that an individual who is attacked can just call the police, but for nations, they have to be their own policemen and/or convince others to defend their rights. Walzer claims that nations have rights based on the rights of the individuals within them. This is against a position Walzer calls "realism" (e.g. Hobbes), which says that because there is no international government, then there really are no laws or even moral facts about the behavior of states toward each other. In the 18th century, Walzer says that leaders like Otto von Bismarck saw war as just a political prerogative, and that the natural condition of nations is for larger ones to take over smaller ones: Only the "balance of power" can keep nations from being aggressive, and when aggression succeeds, the victor writes the history and (legitimately) claims the action to have been just.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Walzer argues that this is nonsense, that of course we can and do judge the behavior of nations. He describes the "legalistic framework" that argues strictly that aggression is never permissible, and no nation should interfere in another's internal affairs. However, Walzer's own view is that there are acceptable exceptions: For example, if a nation is committing genocide against part of its own population, for example, other nations can and should intervene.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So nations &lt;em &gt;can &lt;/em &gt;defend themselves, but &lt;em &gt;must &lt;/em &gt;they? Do other nations have a duty to intervene when they witness aggression? Walzer says that no, the decision to fight is always up to the population in question, and there might be practical reasons not to resist or intervene, but it would always be morally good if &lt;em &gt;someone &lt;/em &gt;did stand up to the aggressor, and appeasement to aggression, even if it saves lives, sacrifices goods that are worth being fought for.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Just-Unjust-Wars-Historical-Illustrations/dp/0465052711" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://dl1.cuni.cz/pluginfile.php/471728/mod_resource/content/1/walzer.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sss/pdfs/Walzer/FourWarsIsrael.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read "The Four Wars of Israel/Palestine &lt;/a &gt;."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you enjoy this, check out &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-72-terrorism-17046752"&gt;our discussion in ep. 72 of terrorism &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here we emerge from talking about a wants/interests dynamic in the individual case to talk about the self-interest of societies and the comparable dynamics in how they improve towards social rationality. To allow this comparison, Railton defines a criterial theory of rationality: It is rational to build a roof according to criteria whereby it will function effectively as a roof. Likewise, it is rational for an individual to act according to objective interest, for a society to act set laws and norms to optimize social rationality, and ultimately we want to get to a theory whereby it is rational for an individual to act according to social rationality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.filosoficas.unam.mx/docs/1110/files/Railton%20Moral%20realism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on PDF p. 21.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/135003600"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on the 1785 course lecture notes Georg Ludwig Collins, as collected in the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/lectures-on-ethics/3165BCC1A91F68ADADBFEC2F4DA4A58E" target="_blank"&gt;Cambridge edition &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We cover "Of Duties to Oneself," which are actually the primary ethical duties. This is not a matter of pursuing your desires, but recognizing your inherent dignity, and respecting that. When you do this, you'll have integrity, and will be in a good position to respect the inherent humanity in others. So don't kill yourself, don't sell your body (or parts of it), don't use yourself as a means to pleasure, and above all, don't abuse your own will by acting according to whim; you need to instead act according to some law, some reasons.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Even some actions that we normally judge due to their negative effects on others are to be condemned on the grounds that they violate the humanity of the actor. When you lie, even if it doesn't hurt anyone, you violate your own integrity. If you hurt animals, or have sex with them, Kant is not so concerned with the animals' pain (they aren't members of the moral community), but you are making yourself into a worse person. We found an unexpected emphasis on this text in honor and pride, which as emotions, do not determine what is moral, but they are important in motivating morality, especially when it comes to duties toward oneself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The only morally legitimate sexual act for Kant is within marriage, as sex involves a revealing of the whole self, an opening to another person, and if you do this but yet try to be casual about it, you are engaged in self-contradiction, and you are debasing yourself and the other person. He is also against homosexuality, for the tedious reason that such sex is not procreative, and so gay sex runs counter to "the ends of humanity." By this logic he should condemn any sex that does not involve both parties being fertile and actively trying to conceive, but he doesn't get into this. Even though sex within marriage is OK, the very nature of the sexual impulse as desiring merely the body of another person is debasing. So yeah, Kant had some problems with the idea of sex.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When it comes to duties to others, Kant is surprisingly egalitarian if not actually socialist. It would be fair if material goods were spread equally among people, but since they aren't (due to nature but moreso unjust social arrangements), it is our duty to give charitably and help correct this natural injustice. So while other moralists might consider charity to be an imperfect duty, i.e. extra credit for which you'd be considered extra virtuous, for Kant, this is just what is due from us our of respect for others' basic humanity, just like not harming them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So generosity is about duty, not about love, and Kant disapproves of overly soft natures that pursue goodness out of love. Ethical duties need to be recognized via reason, not emotions. Once we get in the habit of doing the right thing out of duty, then the feelings will typically follow.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another implication of our owed respect for humanity is that we owe everyone basic good will, even while punishing them. We should honor the humanity in everyone, even if that humanity is occluded by their immoral acts. So condemning someone to death is not incompatible with wishing them well, and in fact capital punishment should only proceed out of respect for the perpetrator: We take your crime seriously, and ensure you pay the debt to humanity that you have incurred with your crime.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;After a part three covering a bit more of this text, for ep. 373 we'll be discussing ch. 4-6 of Michael Walzer's &lt;strong &gt;&lt;a href="https://dl1.cuni.cz/pluginfile.php/471728/mod_resource/content/1/walzer.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Just and Unjust Wars &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/strong &gt;(1977).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the 1784-1785 course lectures given in Konigsberg, via notes from Georg Ludwig Collins. We used the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/lectures-on-ethics/3165BCC1A91F68ADADBFEC2F4DA4A58E" target="_blank"&gt;Cambridge edition &lt;/a &gt;(2013) picked what sections to read via &lt;a href="https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7222 &amp;amp;context=syllabi" target="_blank"&gt;a syllabus we found online &lt;/a &gt;. Featuring Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We originally discussed Kant's ethics via his &lt;em &gt;Groundwork &lt;/em &gt;(also 1785) back in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-10-kantian-we-30313369"&gt;ep. 10 &lt;/a &gt;and wanted to revisit the ideas given our recent work on Korsgaard (a basically Kantian ethicist), and this work had been pointed out to us as being full of specific, practical ethical instructions, not just the abstract meta-ethical theories that Kant is famous for. Knowing that ethics can't pull from anything empirical is fine and good, but how does this, for instance, apply to friendship, which we seem to learn about by observing and experiencing what it is to have and be a good friend? Also, our prejudice about Kant was that his ethics is largely negative, pointing out what would be a moral violation (a violation of the Categorical Imperative), and not so concerned with positive guidance about being a virtuous person. So we wanted to see if that preconception was justified.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The early sections we focus on in this half of the discussion are a bit more high level, including introductory observations and then one called "The Supreme Principle of Morality." In the latter, he discusses the relation between normative ethics and descriptive psychology. While in his better known works, Kant is dismissive of discussions of psychology and human nature as irrelevant to normative ethics, here he acknowledges that of course, in addition to knowing ethical laws, we want to create ethical people, and so need to understand motivation. Like Hume, he acknowledges that passions are what chiefly motivates action, but he leaves a role for the understanding in tending us towards thinking of things in universal terms, which is a necessary ingredient in moral motivation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The "supreme principle" in question is pretty much the Categorical Imperative (as described in his other works), though that term is not used here: "Morality is the conformity of the action to a universally valid law of free choice." To be motivated by a moral feeling, then, is to be affected by a moral judgment of the understanding. He says "Nobody can or ever will comprehend how the understanding should have a motivating power; it can admittedly judge, but to give this judgement power so that it becomes a motive able to impel the will to performance of an action - to understand this is the philosophers' stone." So he seems caught between Hume's theory of motivation and his own theory here; Hume says the understanding cannot be a motive, yet for Kant, ethical laws are entirely a function of the understanding. Yet somehow the rational recognition of ethics results in moral feelings, and we don't really understand how this works.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/class" target="_blank"&gt;Interested in taking Mark's online political philosophy class this fall?&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

So far, he's just been giving us an account of our objective individual interests: What you would want for your current you if you had all the relevant knowledge. He had given an example of a dehydrated person who wants and enjoys milk, even though milk does not help with dehydration in the way that water does. If he had the relevant knowledge, he would water. More precisely, he would want his &lt;em &gt;current &lt;/em &gt;self in the state of dehydration to want water, because who knows what such an all-knowing person would even be like or what his wants for himself would be?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're still picking at the complexities of this as we resume progress in this essay; it's not until the end of this hour that we can even predict where he's going in terms of setting up actual morality, beyond mere objective self-interest.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.filosoficas.unam.mx/docs/1110/files/Railton%20Moral%20realism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on PDF p. 15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/134709214"&gt;Watch the video &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yes, it is surely pleasurable to hang with Mark, Wes, Seth and Dylan trying to make sense of our recent episodes, but is it obligatory? Just because it will make you a smarter, cooler, happier person, is it something you can safely ignore without censure?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Well, given that you pay for PEL, and this Nightcap is part of the experience, not just in the usual way of Nightcaps, but in that we're grappling with (and even quoting!) the very same texts by Korsgaard, Foot, and (to a lesser degree) the accounts of empathy by Scheler and Stein, it would be illogical to skip this one.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So, on Foot vs. Korsgaard: Clearly Foot (like MacIntyre and Bernard Williams) is operating within a virtue ethics framework, and Korsgaard is a self-identifying Kantian, so we might expect that they're simply not talking to each other, and it's true that the reference to each other's work in these books is minimal. But Foot takes great pains to talk about what constitutes a reason for action for people, and of course her (and Aristotle's) idea of virtue involves human rational choice. The specifically human excellence for Foot is not just "reason" generically but a well-functioning human &lt;em &gt;will &lt;/em &gt;; so this all sounds very Kantian.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the other hand, Korsgaard is a synthesist and explicitly tries to find what's right in virtue ethics (specifically Bernard Williams) to include in her account. We are not (as for Kant) merely vessels of choice, but choice refers to human identities, which are both required by and refer to human nature. If human nature were merely an empirical idea (i.e. we look at humans and generalize about how they act), then this would be very un-Kantian. Instead, human nature as virtue ethicists see it is teleological, i.e. directional: humans, when functioning properly, &lt;em &gt;tend &lt;/em &gt;toward their excellence. The word "properly" is only a semi-empirical term, as it involves a guess from looking at a variety of people what they as organisms, and specifically as humans, are aiming at. Rationalists all the way back to Plato take this to mean that we need some kind of ideal (for Kant, "regulative idea") to explain the direction of effort built into our practices in virtually all areas: In mathematics, engineering, science, everyday inquiry, all sorts of actions, and even in language itself we are aiming at truth or goodness or what have you. So if per my human nature I need to identify, e.g. as a member of my family, then that idea has built into it what a good family member would do: support and love other members of the family. If I identify in this way and fail in the consequent duties, then I am being inconsistent. So though this picture from Korsgaard has some elements of Kantianism in it (in that a sinner is inconsistent, and in that ultimate identifications are not optional, but categorical), it also has a lot of virtue ethics built into it as well.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though Korsgaard doesn't (I believe) talk about a "well functioning human" in the way that Foot does, this seems compatible with her talk of basic human needs including the need for identity and consequently the need to identify as a human being and treat other human beings with similar respect due to the humanity they share with the actor.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But can the idea of "well functioning" by itself answer the normative question that Korsgaard asks? Even identifying that I am a human, that I have certain tendencies (toward health and happiness), that I judge other people according to their standards of functioning ("what's wrong with that guy?"), does that normatively obligate me to act according to Foot's idea of well functioning? (Note that this is a separate question from, knowing what it is to be well-functioning, will that motivate me to be so?) This is easier to think about when considering an actual example. Foot says that well function includes acknowledgment of our fundamentally social nature: We are a cooperative species, so we should help each other rather than hurt each other, even when it would be in my self interest to do otherwise.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Certainly if I'm thinking about stealing, it wouldn't be an undeniable motive for me to think, "normal, well-adjusted people don't do this." But on Foot's account, this would be sufficient to establish an objective obligation for me not to steal. Or is the notion of obligation just fundamentally foreign to Foot, given that she's a virtue ethicist? Per our Closereads series on H.A. Prichard, it being a virtue to be honest (which involves not stealing) is fundamentally a different thing from having the obligation to not steal. Doing the right thing (not stealing) does not require having the virtue (being the kind of person who would never steal), and vice versa. So if being a well-functioning human being means being the kind of person who would never steal, we would expect then that such a person would not steal in most situations, though this would be defeasible such that in dire situations (stealing medicine to help a dying person) the person not only would steal, but it would be right to do so.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Perhaps Foot is just following in Hume's footsteps, establishing that morality motivates us in a standard way, and that we thus judge others and hopefully ourselves in line with these standard reactions. If someone feels totally immune to conscience and feels himself to be beyond good and evil, then the moralist can only say "Really? Look further within yourself and you will find conscience there." So normativity reduces to facts about human nature for Foot (or any virtue ethicist), and Korsgaard's demand for something additional to make this normative on individuals is simply misplaced. For Foot, you have an objective well functioning state, and reference to this is a legitimate reason to act according to that state and to fault those who do not act according to that state.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finishing up "Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?" (1912). We finally get to the thesis: Just as global epistemic skepticism is unwarranted, so is skepticism about moral obligation. There is no need for moral philosophy to establish this, and even the contents of morality will largely be given and judged via intuition, with little room for philosophy. The only point of moral philosophy would be to establish these two facts. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/prichard_-_does_moral_philosophy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on PDF p. 13.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding our treatment of &lt;em &gt;The Sources of Normativity &lt;/em &gt;. Listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/134056479"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;first, or better yet, start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-370-christine-132447503"&gt;ep. 370 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start by conveying Korsgaard’s interpretation of Kant, by which the categorical imperative (act such that your maxim can be a law) and the moral law (treat everyone as an end in themselves) aren’t actually the same, since the former could conceivably have a more limited scope; one could act in a lawlike (non-whimsical) way to consistently pursue one’s self-interest, for instance (this would be &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-78-ayn-rand-27506594"&gt;Ayn Rand’s “ethics”&lt;/a &gt;). To obey some law or other means operating from some identity or other, but this doesn’t tell us what identity we should pursue. Korsgaard suggests (following Bernard Williams) that we can rank potential identities as to the degree to which they promote flourishing, and she thinks that an Enlightenment identity whereby we are lawful citizens of the world is clearly better than blood-and-soil tribalism or honor-based identity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then explain Korsgaard’s invocation of Wittgenstein’s private language argument in claiming that reason-making and identities are fundamentally public. If it were purely personal, then it wouldn’t be possible for us to make an error; in any case of normativity (such as “this word properly has this meaning”), there has to be more than one person to establish the standard that one could then fail to meet. We don’t start by justifying reasonable behavior that is purely self-referential (a la Rand); if we were to do this, we would never then be able to extend this out to include other people. Instead, reasons are primarily social, and in fact anyone’s demand for our attention and regard is a prima facie reason to accommodate them, which of course could in most cases be overruled by other considerations.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We try to better make sense of this and how Korsgaard compares to Foot in a Nightcap discussion coming out within the next week. &lt;strong &gt;Next Time &lt;/strong &gt;: We read &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/lectures-on-ethics/3165BCC1A91F68ADADBFEC2F4DA4A58E" target="_blank"&gt;the 1785 ethics lectures of Immanuel Kant &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On lectures 3 and 4 of &lt;em &gt;The Sources of Normativity &lt;/em &gt;(1996), continuing our discussion of the book from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-370-christine-132447503"&gt;ep. 370 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why is morality obligatory on us? According to Korsgaard, it's because we have a primary need for an identity (multiple identities, actually, or rather multiple roles that make up our identity), and this identity involves obligations. If I were to cross some ethical line, then I would no longer be the kind of person I thought I was, and that identity was what provided me with a coherent, meaningful basis for action.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While lecture three just establishes this fact about how identities and obligations connect, lecture four makes this explicitly ethical: Why should your identity necessarily imply respect for others? This is because we have a necessary identity as human beings, and this identity makes all the more specific ones (parent, citizen, member of whatever organization, holder of some office) possible. To identify as a human being is to respect humanity in general, which means respecting the humanity of every other person. So the upshot is a form of Kantianism, where we are supposed to treat people as ends in themselves. While one could identify as an assassin, with the code of an assassin (e.g. only kill the target, not civilians), this would ultimately be an incoherent and thus unsustainable identity, because assassinating fundamentally disrespects the humanity of the victims.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The phenomenology of this is that our self-consciousness divides our desires from our reflective side. We can think about and reflectively endorse some desire, which gives it our sanction: The reflective part commands the active part to follow that desire. When we convert a desire into a reason in this way, even though this consideration is going on in the mind of just one individual, it is relying on potentially public (typically linguistic) considerations. Something that is a legitimate reason is something I could explain to another person, and which could potentially likewise motivate that person. An identity itself (a particular role) is not something an individual creates, but refers to some social (public) entity: What it is to be a family member and have obligations to other family members is determined by a culture, not just by you as an individual. And typically I would be called to perform a family duty by another member of the family expressing some need. So I would feel a desire to help, and my (not necessarily conscious) consideration of my duties as a family member would lead me to consider that desire as legitimate, and so I'd move to help, and could explain (if asked) my behavior by reference to the family relationship.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If the situation is one in which the family member has murdered someone and wants me to help hide the body (or worse, to murder the witnesses), I will (hopefully) feel conflicted. If I identify solely as family member and do not acknowledge the humanity of the victim, then something has gone wrong. This mafia-type notion of family has become unmoored from its status as a subdivision of humanity that adds special duties of care. It's not supposed to suspend all obligations toward those outside the family, to change them into "Others" outside of my circle of moral concern.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Learn about Mark's online political philosophy class at &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/class." target="_blank"&gt;partiallyexaminedlife.com/class.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;More on "Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?" (1912). Prichard continues discussing the relation of motives and dispositions to morality. He highlights distinctions that he thinks are often overlooked in motivating ethics, e.g. between morality (doing the right thing) and virtue (the quality by which one typically does the right thing).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?" (1912). Prichard claims that we feel certain actions to be obligatory, and that we have no justification for doubting those raw intuitions. The situation, he claims, is comparable to epistemology: We have no grounds for doubting globally a la Descartes, but only in particular circumstances where science demands we should go back and check again, but more carefully.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Likewise, we can be wrong about particular moral judgments, but the process of refining them is just to put ourselves (really or imaginatively) in the ethical situation and gauge the intuitions more carefully. So the only legitimate task of moral philosophy is to establish that global doubt is not warranted, and to get us to observe our intuitions more carefully and discuss them with others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/prichard_-_does_moral_philosophy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as ad-free &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/133108091"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We dive further into the text of lectures 1 and 2 of &lt;em &gt;The Sources of Normativity &lt;/em &gt;(1996). Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/132447503"&gt;part one.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Her test for reflective endorsement, which is a method that starts with Hume, goes through Bernard Williams and to Korsgaard's ultimate view, asks us to explain the origins of our moral sentiments, and asks us, knowing the origins now of your own sentiments, do you endorse them? If the view were a Marxist one that morality is just what the bosses have brainwashed you into believing, then realizing this would (hopefully) free you from those views. Even if out of habit, you still found yourself agreeing with them, you would know that they are not justified. For Hume, though, even though we know we come about our moral sentiments naturally (through evolution or whatnot), we still like that nature gave these to us, because they make our lives easier. So one way of endorsing the verdicts or morality is to judge them via another standard, such as self-interest: Hume says that of course we want to be loved, so it's great that we have sentiments that encourage us to help other people, which is likely to generate such love in return.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to Bernard Williams, we have many such standards to choose from, corresponding to all the cultures and sub-cultures we're familiar with, so we can use one to judge another. We can judge some alleged ethical reason from the point of view of self-interest, benevolence, and even the point of view of that ethics itself (sometimes ethical commandments are internally incoherent). The standpoint that trumps them all, however, is that of human flourishing (eudaimonia). Moral progress is possible because we can judge what we have inherited from culture against the acquired human wisdom of how well these ethical practices have worked out in helping people maximize their potential.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Korsgaard concludes the second lecture by setting the stage for her own theory: According to Kant, an autonomous moral agent is one who evaluates their desires reflectively to see which ones can serve as reasons, which Kant characterizes as &lt;em &gt;laws &lt;/em &gt;for action. In our next episode, we'll go into how Korsgaard interprets and tweaks the idea of a law of motivation, such that being a law of motivation is &lt;em &gt;not sufficient &lt;/em &gt;for according with &lt;em &gt;the moral law &lt;/em &gt;, unless the scope of the law ranges over other people (and unlike Kant, Korsgaard wants to include animals as well under the category of creatures we have duties towards). So a law of motivation could just be a commitment to act consistently and coherently, i.e. according to reasons, instead of just following each desire as it comes up (the law could even be "I will act strictly according to each desire as it comes up"!); this would fall far short of morality. So in our next episode, we'll describe how according to Korsgaard, consideration of others is built right into the idea of reasoning, which is an inherently public activity (per &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-56-more-on-17044181"&gt;Wittgenstein's private language argument &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Sources of Normativity &lt;/em &gt;, lectures 1 and 2, which were delivered in 1992, published 1996. Featuring Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How are facts related to obligations? Korsgaard's own view is a tweaked view of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-10-kantian-we-30313369"&gt;Kantianism &lt;/a &gt;, and we'll be laying that out in ep. 371, but she presents this view as the result and synthesis of a progression of previous views starting with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-3-hobbess-30313074"&gt;Thomas Hobbes &lt;/a &gt;(and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_von_Pufendorf" target="_blank"&gt;Samuel von Pufendorf &lt;/a &gt;) who were grappling with the place of normativity (the "ought" quality that makes some actions obligatory) in a scientific world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whereas Plato and Aristotle had no problem with positing the essence of reality as something beyond and better than what you actually see, toward which things naturally gravitate, this teleological picture was banished with the scientific revolution. If the world is just made up of matter following natural laws, where is there room for the idea that situations or people or their actions "ought" to be some way other than they are? For "voluntarists" like Hobbes and Pufendorf, this could only come from someone commanding you do to things, and then backing up those commands with force. But as we know from existentialism, the fact that someone (even God!) commands something is not sufficient to justify its rightness for me. The presence of sanctions for disobeying is a motivation to obey, sure, but this still doesn't make the command morally right.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Korsgaard goes on to claim that Hume's view, if characterized by saying simply that we all have moral sentiments, is incomplete. The fact that we naturally have such sentiments does not make those sentiments justified, and Hume knows this. Something additional is needed: We have to on reflection approve of those sentiments (and we could of course be wrong in this reflection and require further reflection, ad nauseam, just as science can always continue to investigate something and improve its views). This is a core component of Korsgaard's own theory: Morality is characterized by &lt;strong &gt;reflective endorsement &lt;/strong &gt;, where you have some desire to act in a certain way, and by thinking about it, you might make that desire into a reason. But what can ground such an endorsement?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Moral realists like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-58-what-moore-17045411"&gt;G.E. Moore &lt;/a &gt;argued that there is room in a scientific picture of the world for a special class of entity, moral facts, which are not reducible to people's commands or their happiness or other sentiments. We intuitively recognize these facts as basic components of our experienced universe: We simply "see" that an action or principle is right or wrong, that a state of affairs or of someone's character is good or bad. This was famously countered by &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/sum2020/entries/moral-anti-realism/moral-error-theory.html" target="_blank"&gt;J.L. Mackie via the "argument from queerness"&lt;/a &gt;: These moral entities and these moral intuitions sure do sound weird given our usual scientific talk!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Korsgaard will end up saying that moral facts are part of our experienced world (they are real), but they are a phenomena of our will, not part of physics and chemistry or biology. Only scientism--the insistence that humanistic things like consciousness, morality and art can only be understood in terms of these physical sciences--would cause us to reject the furniture of our consciousness as somehow unreal. We have to theorize about morality in the setting where we encounter it; if we try to reduce it to mere facts about human nature, brain chemistry, etc., we will lose sight of its normative character.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Korsgaard, normativity, the obligatory character of some actions, ends up being real for us, insofar as we have certain human needs such as the need for what Bernard Williams calls a "thick identity" that involves certain actions being off-limits. So Aristotle ends up being right after all, just in that human flourishing is implicated in our reflective endorsement of moral reasons for action.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The key Kantian element here is that the fact on which value is based cannot be something outside of our own will. It's not that I note that some actions are likely to cause my flourishing (and/or the flourishing of others), and I realize that I want to flourish, and so I do that thing (this was more or less Philippa Foot's view), but that the act of considering and endorsing this pro-flourishing desire involves my subjugating the part of me that acts to the part of me that thinks, and for reflective endorsement to happen at all, I must act within various entities including most importantly my identity as a human being among other human beings, and in doing this, I give myself moral commands. So the voluntarists (Hobbes) were right that morality is a command, but it's a command we give ourselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If this is confusing, we'll lay it out in much more detail in ep. 370, but I wanted to point you in the direction she's heading in the part of the book we discuss here.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/sources-of-normativity/5A85034A6566FDFDE374073A015CBD2A" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://tannerlectures.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/105/2024/06/korsgaard94.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;check out this online version of the original lectures &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

What's the rational thing to do when morality conflicts with self-interest?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Seth return to talk through the last three chapters of &lt;em &gt;Natural Goodness &lt;/em &gt;, examining Foot's alleged difference between animal and plant goods on the one hand and specifically human good on the other. She locates the latter in our rational will, in our ability to make choices, though at the same time she does not share Kant's insistence that the only way in which we are "good," the only criteria that could best determine our actions, lies in our rational decision-making.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The chapter we ended &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-369-philippa-131413167"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;on had to do with practical rationality, and argued that insofar as we are well-functioning humans, we make decisions based on rational grounds. We do not typically aim explicitly at being a well-functioning person, but when functioning properly, we aim at things at which a good person aims, such as doing good rather than harm to others. Foot disagrees with Hume that we are only motivated by desires and feelings; we can and should be motivated by reasons, even as our desires and feelings can be among these reasons. The source of normativity in the world, the "shouldness" of certain actions, is that we have reasons for doing certain things, we weigh and select among these, and decide what to do (what we "should" do) all things considered.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This picture gave us two concerns: First, does it make sense for the picture of ethics here to focus so much on rational choice given how irrational and undeliberate people typically are? Second, does this difference between human good (focused on a well functioning rational will) and animal/plant good (focused on health) undermine her whole Aristotelian thesis that virtue for humans is comparable to virtue for animals and plants? Foot does not seem concerned about the first of these issues; we're trying to say what the human good is, not how people typically act. But (Seth claims) it does seem a problem if very very few people are "well functioning" in Foot's conception, given that this is supposed to be empirical: We determine what adequate function means because this is how this type of creature (humanity, in this case) tends to look, not because we somehow divine a secret, virtuous destiny that few among the species actually achieve.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The second issue is one Foot addresses at length: Chapter Five is called "Human Goodness," and gives Aristotle's distinction at length between voluntary acts (the ones morality, i.e. evaluation of our adequate function as humans, deals with) and less voluntary ones, which includes not just cases like drunken action, but action through ignorance. Of course, ignorance may itself be voluntary, as when someone neglects to learn what one could reasonably be expected to. So having qualities such as conscientiousness, and more generally practical wisdom (phronesis) ends up being relevant morally, even though we cannot simply will ourselves to have them, so morality is is not all about voluntary choice but about being the kind of person whose choice capabilities are functioning well. While this is not an ability that animals and plants have, it is still part of our natural makeup; our virtue can be evaluated based on that makeup and not merely (per Kant) on the rightness of our motives in each case. This is all in accord with Aristotle, who of course had the idea of a telos (natural goodness) for each kind of creature, but distinguished humanity as the rational animal, and so our telos as concerning rationality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Chapter Six is called "Happiness and the Human Good," and continues Foot's deliberations about whether moral fitness and the natural, ultimate object of our choice--i.e. happiness or in Greek eudaimonia--are always in harmony. In one sense, a former concentration camp guard or other villain might seem to be living a happy, peaceful life, but Foot claims that such people cannot have &lt;em &gt;deep &lt;/em &gt;happiness, which extends to the underlying thoughts that they have about themselves and their lives.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Foot conversely describes those who defied the Nazis and wrote letters about this before they were killed. Such people's lives didn't "work out," but these (predominantly religious) people described themselves as satisfied with their choices: Happiness in the recognizable sense simply wasn't achievable for them, because it wasn't attainable by honorable means. If happiness meant accepting the Nazis, and happiness isolated from virtue isn't deep happiness, then they chose the "happier" outcome in dying for their beliefs.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The final chapter, "Immoralism," extends these considerations to consider whether, e.g. the view of Thrasymachus (Socrates' antagonist in The Republic who insists that virtue is just the dictates of the stronger) is compatible with real friendship (it is not). Our concern, addressed briefly at the end of our discussion here, is with her take on Nietzsche, whom she accuses of in large part &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;being an immoralist as he sometimes seems to claim, but just a moral reformer, questioning values such as pity as not actually in line with human goodness. However, when Nietzsche praises cruelty as a necessary part of human nature, Foot says he is confusing animal goodness (which may well involve zero-sum, carnivorous behavior) with human goodness. Foot denies Nietzsche's claim that goodness is not a species matter but wholly individualistic, so no action (even rape and murder) is simply wrong but needs to be evaluated in terms of the individual performing the action. Even more damningly, Nietzsche claimed that only that individual is in the position to legitimately evaluate their own actions: Individuals must create their own values rather than paying heed to anyone else. Foot thought that this view was simply not supported by observation. There are clear species-level matters of human good, such as the human need to be protected from oppressors, that Nietzsche failed to recognize.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Derek Parfit's "Prudence, Morality, and the Prisoner's Dilemma" (1978). What is a "prisoner's dilemma" and what is its relevance to ethics? In general, it's better for me if I break norms so long as others in general follow them, but if we all try to be free riders in this way, then no one gets to ride at all. Parfit considers variations of this situation and lays out legislative and ideological/psychological strategies for addressing them. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/2263/65p539.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as ad-free &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/131841217"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

How and why do we decide to keep promises, even in cases where violating them would produce more utility? How do we take into account different kinds of grounds in moral reasoning?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also refine Foot's account of specifically human goodness. To give one example: For most animals, not reproducing would indicate a deviation from the norm that indicates something's gone wrong. However, people can of course choose to not have children without moral defect, and even if someone biologically can't have children, this ability is not central to human goodness, which specifically has to do with the choosing will. Given that emphasis on a "normal" will, is there room in Foot's view for real moral excellence, going above and beyond?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Seth subsequently recorded a part three to complete our treatment of this book, which will be released within the next week or so, just for you supporters.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;: We'll be recording two episodes on Christine Korsgaard's &lt;em &gt;The Sources of Normativity (1996)&lt;/em &gt;, the first of which will walk us through the history of ethical theory as it regards the question of what makes ethics obligatory; what gives an ethical command normative force?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Natural Goodness &lt;/em &gt;(2001), Foot's only book (she died in 2010), which summed up her thoughts on ethics after publishing many influential papers in that area going back to 1959. Featuring Mark, Wes, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Can we base ethics on the model of biology? Foot channels Aristotle in arguing that just as we understand what a healthy specimen of a plant or animal is that fulfills expectations for that species (i.e. nothing "is wrong with it"), so there is a natural way for humans to lack disfigurement. Of course, uniquely human capabilities make human goodness differ from that of other animals, in that we make reflective choices. According to Foot, if I were to, for instance, choose to be a free rider, relying on others to act morally while I do not, then there would be something wrong with me, specifically with the way in which I engage in moral reasoning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Even when considering animals, Foot's take is a little different than Aristotle's, in that she emphasizes that not all characteristics that make a good specimen of the animal necessarily benefit that individual animal. An animal may naturally sacrifice some of its individual benefit for its offspring (may even routinely die in producing offspring!), but that's still a part of its natural goodness. Likewise, for people, we are not self-interest maximizers; I may be a faulty human being given our species' usual requirement for cooperative effort if I fail in these efforts, even if I end up in thriving health and joy. Still, she shares Aristotle's overall approach in treating moral virtue and non-moral virtues as not fundamentally different, yet in tying the distinctly human virtues to our ability to make reflective, reasoned choices.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Foot adds to this Aristotelian framework a way of talking about practical rationality from Hume and Kant: Morality is not just a matter of identifying what is good or virtuous, but of motivating people to do good and be virtuous. If I'm being a free rider (taking benefits without putting in work) and someone says "it's not normal for your species to act like this," will this convince me? No, but if I'm making a reasoned choice, and I have normal sentiments, then I will feel averse to being a free rider. For Kant, there's something about the very structure of the will itself such that I will see moral commandments as obligatory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to Foot, we can recognize and respond to motivating reasons whether our desires are involved or not. She rejects the Kantian Categorical Imperative but retains the idea (against Hume) that the will can be motivated by reasons, and (per Aristotle) that virtuous people will be motivated not by the reason that they want to be "normal" but by a complex of reasons that have to do with getting along and thriving in the world, which include self-interest, yes, but also sympathy for others, duty, what society tells them is moral, etc. All of these go into moral reasoning, so perhaps surprisingly, in some circumstances, a wise moral agent will find that acting in a typically moral way is not called for in some case, all things considered. For example, I have a moral obligation to keep an appointment, but I feel sick and decide to break that in order to stay home and feel better. Here, a fundamentally self-interested reason overrules a specifically moral obligation here, yet there's nothing immoral about this decision.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/natural-goodness-9780199265473?cc=us &amp;amp;lang=en &amp;amp;" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/naturalgoodness0000foot" target="_blank"&gt;try it online &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/laurier/textes/phi-6330-h12/Foot-Morality-Hypothetical-Imperatives-72.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Here's her 1972 essay on hypothetical imperatives &lt;/a &gt;that we bring up. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

A passion is being affected by something that we don't understand, whereas reason (which will yield ethical behavior) involves grasping a cause clearly and distinctly. The latter means it's in your individual mind, whereas even if you don't understand the cause, it's still in God's mind, which each of us is essentially a part of.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://ia601403.us.archive.org/9/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.263056/2015.263056.Ethics_text.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 83 (PDF p. 129).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as ad-free &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/130774824"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude our discussion of &lt;em &gt;A Treatise of Human Nature &lt;/em &gt;(1739): Book III, “Of Morals,” plus a bit more discussion of &lt;em &gt;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals &lt;/em &gt;(1751). Listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/130468936"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;first, or better yet, start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-367-hume-on-129109975"&gt;ep. 367 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How do moral sentiments fit into Hume’s overall philosophy of mind? Hume famously our conscious experience to be composed solely of impressions and ideas. Any sentiment would have to be an impression, but like many impressions, a moral sentiment contains reference to something in the world, i.e. the behavior or whatever that we’re morally judging. Yet Hume’s point is that even though “this is good” is a sentence that looks to be about that referent, it’s made true by sentiment lying in us. And if ethical claims are really about ourselves, then they’re just expressive and can’t actually be true or false. Someone’s moral sense can be stunted or otherwise faulty, but morality is still fundamentally a matter of taste. So does this make Hume a relativist?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about sociopaths, animals, incest, consent, ethics vs. beauty, moral luck, and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Time: &lt;/strong &gt;We’re reading Philippa Foot’s &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/naturalgoodness0000foot" target="_blank"&gt;Natural Goodness &lt;/a &gt;(2001), especially chapters 1-4.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing our treatment from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-367-hume-on-129109975"&gt;ep. 367 &lt;/a &gt;, we talk a bit more about David Hume's &lt;em &gt;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals &lt;/em &gt;(1751), specifically on the conclusion and Appendix I, "Concerning Moral Sentiment," and add some parts of &lt;em &gt;A Treatise of Human Nature &lt;/em &gt;(1739): sec. 3 "Of the Influencing Motives of the Will" within the third part of Book II, "Of the Passions," and the first two sections of Book III, "Of Morals."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Can reason by itself motivate moral action? Hume says no: All ethical reasons must point ultimately to sentiments, which we can generalize about (saying that in general we approve what brings about utility, for instance) but which are themselves epistemically basic. We can't tell what's good or bad without these feelings, and even if we could, the feelings are required to get us to act.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hume claims that obligation can't be something divorced from human motivation. Though some individuals may be morally insensitive in some respects, a moral sense is a fundamental part of human nature, and this doesn't require further explication (as, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-41-pat-on-of-15462949"&gt;evolutionary biologists &lt;/a &gt;might give us). In fact, if we say that we only feel such sentiments because of some specific fact about human nature or development, this is interesting scientifically, but ethically irrelevant: Knowing &lt;em &gt;that &lt;/em &gt;most people feel this way or that we are typically programmed to do so does not provide a justification for &lt;em &gt;you &lt;/em &gt;to feel this way if you don't already; this is an instance of Hume's vaunted fact-value distinction. To say that morality can be grounded in matters of fact is to deny this distinction. Instead, it is grounded, irreducibly, in nothing but itself. (We can see how this would later lead &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-58-what-moore-17045411"&gt;G.E. Moore &lt;/a &gt;to define a class of specifically "ethical facts" detectable by ethical intuitions, irreducible to any facts about happiness, health, pleasure, etc.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Of course, moral evaluation and decision-making involve recognition of (and so reasoning about) many factual issues, such as "Did this person really perform that action, and with what motive?" But knowing such facts (i.e. using reason to ascertain them and their relations) would not be sufficient to generate the moral evaluation without moral sentiment contributing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/treatiseofhumann002393mbp/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank"&gt;Here's an online version of the Treatise &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/enquiryconcern00hume/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank"&gt;here again is the Enquiry &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy). &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

It's fine if you haven't heard those, as we're more or less starting fresh: skipping several pages from our last installment to start with section 3 on the recommendation from a member of the International Scheler society, hoping that at least we will find out what makes a person: What makes each of us unique and worthy of moral respect?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Formalism-In-Ethics-And-Non-formal-Ethics-Of-Values-Max-Scheler.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 382 (PDF p. 415).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/130200471"&gt;Watch the video &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

We finish the lengthy sec. 3, "The Constitution of the Person in Emotional Experiences" on the relation of willing to the self, then the shorter sec. 4, "The Givenness of the Foreign Person" and 5, "Soul and Person," which finally gets us to Stein's idea that we have some core personality that would be the same even if our environment was totally different, that contains potential that can be fulfilled or not, and that this is what love latches onto and what demands our moral respect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://stmaryscathedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/On-the-Problem-of-Empathy-Edith-Stein-auth-z-liborg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p97 (PDF p117).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

We dive into ch. 2 on justice: Hume says that the idea of property is not natural, but is an artificial construct created for utilitarian purposes. This means that property laws will be different in different societies based on what is scarce enough to require regulation and protection.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hume's idea of "utility" is very wide; there are some virtues Hume says we have moral respect for which are not socially useful, but only personally useful. We admire when someone has strength of mind or other qualities that are merely pleasing to that has them. This means that Hume does not draw a sharp line between moral and non-moral types of excellence. However, he does want to distinguish, e.g. strength of mind from avarice; avarice could be a quality that will benefit a person (financially), and in general financial benefit is a type of utility, yet we don't morally admire avarice.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about who is a member of the moral community according to Hume, moral progress, his relation to social contract theory, relativism, utility vs. beauty, sympathy, how to deal with a truly malevolent individual, and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We'll wrap up our treatment of this book (the conclusion and first appendix) and bring in Hume's earlier work, &lt;em &gt;A Treatise of Human Nature &lt;/em &gt;(1739), specifically looking at two sections: Book II: Of the Passions, Part 3 Of the Will and Direct Passions, section 3, “Of the Influencing Motives of the Will"; and Book III: Of Morals, Part 1 Of Virtue and Vice in General, sections 1 and 2.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On David Hume's &lt;em &gt;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals &lt;/em &gt;(1751), featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth. What is morality, and how can we know it?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We've been discussing the bases of morality of late: Are fundamental principles revealed to us by reason (perhaps "rational intuition"), or by sentiment (e.g. our feelings of empathy with others. Hume is a chief voice in the latter category: We simply find ourselves approving and disapproving of various things, being attracted to or repelled by them, even when we're just hearing about them and they won't personally affect us. We feel indignant when we feel about atrocities happening wherever they may occur, and we feel admiration for hearing about some great benefactor, even these benefits were bestowed centuries ago.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So Hume sees his task as scanning these basic moral sentiments and looking for patterns, and in general he sees us admiring actions and people that do great good for many people: the principle of utility. You might have thought that we have, for instance, a particular, fundamental sentiment in favor of justice, but justice is only good insofar as it is serving this utility function.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This all raises some questions for us (and Hume's various critics): Why, for instance, if justice is only as good as the utility it brings, should we affirm the judgments of justice when they produce a bad outcome? Socrates' jurors were justly appointed, and his trial was not fixed, yet the condemnation of Socrates by these wheels of justice was (by most accounts) unjust, and certainly didn't seem at the time to be a net boon for Athenian society or the world. Moreover, even if we want to say that selective violation of law is too corrosive to society to allow, why would Socrates himself feel obligated (as he says he is in the Crito) to go along with the verdict? Socrates' reasoning in the Crito is that he made a deal with society by accepting its boons, so he owes it his allegiance even when it has yielded the wrong verdict. Hume's utility-based reasoning can't seem to make sense of this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So Hume is claiming that moral rules, though based on our sentiments, are still binding on us, i.e. are still moral rules. This means that reason does have a role here, even though it's not the ultimate source of morality. Once we've determined that our sentiments support utility, then we can apply reason to counter-balance our self-interest in cases where our own benefit goes against the common good. Hume stresses that our basic sentiments are &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;entirely oriented according to our self-interest (as thinkers like Hobbes claimed); we do experience empathy as a basic part of our moral feeling. But still, there are many illusions in moral perception just as there are in visual perception: A far-away tower looks small, yet we know it is not. Likewise, the greatness or vileness of actions distant from us as individual look to be of less consequence than those that happen nearby, yet we can use reason to correct this distortion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So even though morality is fundamentally based on feeling, it is a &lt;em &gt;cool &lt;/em &gt;feeling of evaluation, which should overrule hot feelings of revenge, ecstatic love, etc.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://hackettpublishing.com/philosophy/moral-philosophy/an-enquiry-concerning-the-principles-of-morals" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the edition we used &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/enquiryconcern00hume/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank"&gt;read an online edition &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-45-moral-hume-15467492"&gt;our previous episode (#45!) on Hume and Smith &lt;/a &gt;to get some context for how moral sense theory gets applied.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

How do emotions expose, or perhaps even constitute, the self? &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is partly a matter of the value judgments present in emotions, so we are defined by what we love and loathe. When someone loves you, they use your emotions and values to fix their love onto you, yet since love is supposed to be unconditional, it will persist even if you change your mind and value different things. However, if you were being deceitful, and someone loved you because of that, then when the real you is exposed, their love can recede, because they were loving only a phantom, not via your real emotionally revealed values. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://stmaryscathedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/On-the-Problem-of-Empathy-Edith-Stein-auth-z-liborg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p92 (PDF p112).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes discuss "On the Problem of Empathy," ch. 4 "Empathy as the Comprehension of Mental Persons," starting with section 2, "The Mental Subject" and into section 3, "The Constitution of the Person in Emotional Experiences." (So this is the same book as &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-366-edith-on-128004342"&gt;PEL ep 366 &lt;/a &gt;, so you can consider this a continuation of that discussion, even though Wes wasn't on it and hadn't heard it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're trying to figure out what these early 20th century German phenomenologists think a "person" is as someone we're able to empathize or sympathize with and which is morally worthy of respect. Stein does this by saying what the "I" (the self) is. It is the thing that "has" experiences, but also something that we understand in terms of a network of motivations, which are different than mere causes, in that they're supposed to be rational. Our self gains definition, Stein says, when we have emotional experiences, which can of course be shallow and undirected (mere moods) or can be very deep and self-revelatory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://stmaryscathedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/On-the-Problem-of-Empathy-Edith-Stein-auth-z-liborg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 87 (PDF p. 107).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as ad-free &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/128229577"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

We start out by thinking more about what "primordiality" means, such that we have a non-primordial relation to those experiences of other people whom we're empathizing with as well as our remembered experiences and the not-immediately-visible but implied sides of the objects we encounter.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next, we map out her strategy in the bulk of the book in presenting a phenomenology of the individual that then allows empathy relations to occur. People have to be explicable by a network of motivations, which are different than mere causes. We can't empathize with a rock even if we understand its physical dispositions (e.g. from gravity it "wants" to descend). When people (or animals?) act, they do so for reasons that we can latch on to and empathize with. These networks of reasons give us the means to expand our horizons; because we assume that people have understandable motivations, when they act or react in a way that is strange or unexpected, we can potentially learn why a person might see things they way they do.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we try to get clearer on how Stein disagrees with Scheler despite the similarities in their views. It seems that Stein allows us to better understand how people can deceive each other about their emotions, as well as how reciprocal empathy allows us to build a "we" that is the subject of a shared experience.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite Stein's use of phenomenology, which is not supposed to be natural science, we relate her discussion to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-326-guest-on-89970564"&gt;our interview with Michael Tomasello on the origins of agency &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Time: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading David Hume's &lt;em &gt;Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Problem of Empathy &lt;/em &gt;(1917), featuring Mark, Seth, and Dylan. What is empathy, and what is its significance?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Stein was &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/closereads-on-124860764"&gt;Edmund Husserl's &lt;/a &gt;research assistant, and this book adapted her doctoral dissertation (so long before she became a &lt;a href="https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19981011_edith_stein_en.html" target="_blank"&gt;Catholic saint &lt;/a &gt;and died in the Holocaust). It was very much in dialogue with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-364-max-on-125400620"&gt;Scheler's book on sympathy &lt;/a &gt;(among his other works), whose first edition Stein had read and is responding to, and whose second edition in turn responds to Stein.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Stein agrees with Scheler that empathy and sympathy are not types of egoism; I really am feeling someone who is irreducibly another person (not just a reinterpreted extension of myself), and in fact Stein accuses Scheler of having a phenomenologically false developmental picture whereby you start by having ideas or experiences which are not attributed explicitly to oneself, and then come to differentiate your thoughts from those of other. This idea fits with Scheler's idea that we can acquire thoughts, habits, and practices from other people through "contagion," e.g. thinking a certain way just because your parents did. Stein does not deny that this takes place, but even if your thought came from your parents, Stein still insists that you always know that it's yours; there is no confusion between you and other people.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whereas for Scheler, sympathy is a one-stage process whereby I take someone else's emotional state as my object, for Stein, empathy has three stages, of which Scheler's sympathy is only the first. Yes, I take someone else's sorrow (for instance) as my object of consideration, but then I am drawn in and instead focus on the other person's object (e.g. the thing the person is sad about). Finally, I withdraw and have a richer understanding of the other person.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scheler probably wouldn't like the second stage of this, which sounds too much like "putting yourself in their shoes," i.e. identifying with them. Stein compares this process of contemplating another person's emotional state (and the objects of that state: what the person is sad about) with your own process of memory, and she introduces the distinction between primordial and non-primordial experience. If I go to the zoo, I have a primordial experience of the animals and such. If I then remember going to the zoo, I am taking my past self and its experience as an object. I can summarize the experience or try to re-live it step by step, but either way, I am relating non-primordially to that experience. Likewise, in empathy, when I consider the other person's sorrow, that other person is having a primordial emotional experience, and I in turn in my observational and imaginative exploration of that experience am having it non-primordially.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;At no point do I mistakenly think that I'm that other person, or twist the experience so as to imagine how I would act in a similar situation (or how I have reacted in the past to similar situations). I really am focused on the other person's experience as theirs, but I nonetheless am relating myself to it in a pretty direct way. I don't have to look at the person's expression and merely &lt;em &gt;infer &lt;/em &gt;that they're having such an experience. I just read the expression as a partially concealed event that's happening in the public world. (It's partially concealed because I could be wrong about it, e.g. maybe the person is suppressing or hiding their sadness, but I still use the same empathic techniques to see through such moves.) So empathy is not just me making up something about the other person, but witnessing it, in a way that involves my (imaginatively) entering into it while never getting confused about what I'm doing. Per Scheler's arguments, for Stein I don't get infected by the experience (it does not become mine, or if it does, that's not part of empathy but something else), nor do the lines between the other person and me get otherwise blurred.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Stein claims that Scheler in describing sympathy just doesn't believe that Stein-type empathy is possible; the "entering into the experience" would inevitably involve violating the requirement that the Other remains Other. For Stein, empathy as she describes it is the necessary precondition for grasping other people on a deep level. The bulk of the book is a phenomenological analysis of what it is to be a person in the world (prefiguring similar though much longer analyses by &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-297-heidegger-69019342"&gt;Heidegger &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/closereads-ponty-111484199"&gt;Merleau-Ponty &lt;/a &gt;) such that other people could thus connect with you.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about what phenomenological method is for Stein and how it relates to science, how this public presence of emotions works (how facial expressions, for instance, signify emotions and how we encounter emotions as part of the other's "living body"), and whether this idea of "primordiality" makes sense.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://stmaryscathedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/On-the-Problem-of-Empathy-Edith-Stein-auth-z-liborg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://stmaryscathedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/On-the-Problem-of-Empathy-Edith-Stein-auth-z-liborg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on Ch. 6 "Formalism and Person," in Max Scheler's &lt;em &gt;Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values &lt;/em &gt;(1916), section 2, "Person and the 'Ego' of Transcendental Apperception."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scheler is still at this point trying to explain how his concept of personhood differs from Kant's. For one, Kant regards people as valuable (i.e. as people) only insofar as they are rational subjects, which is not where Scheler is going to go. The ego is not just something we have to posit to account for the unity over time of what we experience, but is itself a part of the experienced phenomena.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Formalism-In-Ethics-And-Non-formal-Ethics-Of-Values-Max-Scheler.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;: starting on p. 375 (PDF p. 408).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude our treatment of Max Scheler's &lt;em &gt;The Nature of Sympathy &lt;/em &gt;(1922). We briefly revisit Part I to connect sympathy to love: If you love someone, you can't &lt;em &gt;help &lt;/em &gt;but have sympathy with them when they suffer. Feeling sympathy without love, i.e. mere pity, will actually injure the pride of your object. Listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/127013840"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;first, or better yet, start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-364-max-on-125400620"&gt;ep. 364 &lt;/a &gt;where we start discussing this book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then get into more of the text of Part II on love and hatred. Re. hatred (which we're more interested in than Scheler seems to be), Scheler's formula dictates that we're descending the ladder from higher to lower value: You see the worst in someone, and you want the worst for them, and this typically has a negative effect on both of us. But do we really hate without reason? How are love and hatred so closely related, such that someone you love can become someone you hate? Scheler does not explore these issues in any serious way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scheler says that love is creative, and hatred is destructive. We are essentially adding or subtracting value to our object: We make someone or something better than worse; this rather sounds like Nietzsche's "creation of values," yet not in an ungrounded way. Per Brentano, values are objective things that we discover, so love is a way of making yourself more sensitive to the goodness in someone or something, and by loving, we make that goodness manifest, adding it to the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scheler clarifies that we do not in this process love goodness itself; that abstract quality is not something that can be an object of love, and in fact we are adding goodness to the world by loving, so loving the good wouldn't make sense. We in fact don't like any qualities that people have, but love their "personality," which is a curious notion in Scheler that we will explore a bit further via Closereads. "Personality" is a technical term which does not refer to the qualities people exhibit ("I love your bubbly personality."), nor does it (contra Wes on here) refer to one's abstract personhood qua membership in the human species (our "species being" per &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-356-feuerbach-117110226"&gt;Feuerbach &lt;/a &gt;). We love something that is unique to our loved object, yet it's not those tangible qualities that can change over time, but something essential about them. Scheler says it's something that we can never know directly and in full (only God can), so it must have something to do with the other person's inner life or soul, but he doesn't give us a good picture in this book of what this is and how we can relate ourselves to it. Its inaccessibility means that we treat it as irreducibly Other to ourselves, but we clearly can know it enough to love it, i.e. to note and increase its evident value.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude by talking about our love for our pets. What would Scheler say?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We will talk more about how we relate to others' inner lives with &lt;strong &gt;our next episode &lt;/strong &gt;, which will be on Edith Stein's &lt;em &gt;On the Problem of Empathy &lt;/em &gt;. This was her dissertation, and came out in 1917, so she'd read the first edition of Scheler's &lt;em &gt;The Nature of Sympathy &lt;/em &gt;(1913), but then he responded to her thoughts in his subsequent 1922 edition that we read.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Nature of Sympathy &lt;/em &gt;(1922), Part II: “Love and Hatred.” The end of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-364-max-on-125400620"&gt;part I on fellow-feeling &lt;/a &gt;clarifies that we can only sympathize at the deepest level with someone if we love them, so what is love exactly, and how does it relate to ethics?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2025/03/15/ep-363-1-brentano-ethics-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Brentano &lt;/a &gt;(Scheler’s chief ethical influence), love was amoral in itself but is a component in our ethical intuitions: Something is good if we understand that we love it rightly. So love is a necessary part of the toolset we use to understand morals, but does not in itself tell us what is right (we could wrongly love a villain).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scheler’s story is a little more subtle: Love is a primitive, spontaneous movement from lower to higher values. When you love someone, you see the best in them, and the light of receiving that love gives them power to more fully realize that excellence. It is not a statement that the loved one is valuable, but a &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-186-j-l-on-17643711"&gt;performative &lt;/a &gt;that aims to climb the ladder of value, rather like in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-100-platos-33200350"&gt;Plato’s Symposium &lt;/a &gt;, though Scheler has a more tolerant attitude towards sensual love. For Plato (i.e. the character of Diotima in the &lt;em &gt;Symposium &lt;/em &gt;), sexual desire is transformed by love into something more spiritual and ultimately not sensual at all; it’s ultimately about the love of Good. For Scheler, the goodness is not separable from the loved on in all their messy materiality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While Scheler is dismissive of pure lust, sexual love is for him a legitimate kind of love in its own right, attempting to grasp and elevate someone in their deepest being. Scheler emphasizes that there are just fundamentally different types of love, and Freud is wrong in trying to derive motherly love, filial love, and love of home and country from the sexual (libido). Scheler also wants to allow for the possibility that we can love art or God, even though the dynamics in such love would be different, as there’s not some individual loved person that could be in any way improved by your love for it in those cases. Even in the case of love for your child, the case is a little difficult to state, though quite familiar to experience: It’s not that love is conditional, i.e. “I love the person that I think you will grow into, so if you don’t in fact grow that way, I will be disappointed and realize I was wrong,” and neither does it ignore the condition of growth, i.e. “I love you just the way you are” or “I don’t care how you develop over time.” It is a catalyst and support for good growth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There is a limit to what we can love; he says we can love art but not food, though he does not tell us much about art to distinguish this. Spinoza said that love is just being pleased by something and attributing it the pleasure to that cause. For Scheler, this is absolutely wrong; love is fundamentally different than merely being knowingly pleased by something. Presumably, then, if I love art, I am connecting with the personal creativity in it, which he thinks is not present in food (though perhaps he should allow for gourmet food to have such a soul, whereas commercial art does does not). Suffice it to say that love of a person is the paradigm case, and so love of art or or God, or a motherly love by a woman who does not yet have children (maybe a longing for children), or a “love of love” among a romantic who does not have a partner… All these are borderline cases that tell us something about love as a dispositional attitude and not just an act aimed at a specific loved object that can potentially love you back.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scheler emphasizes that love is always a free, spontaneous act, even when it’s in response to the other person’s love for you, or even when the loved one is very attractive. Nothing can force us to love someone or something. When we say “I love X because Y,” those reasons Y are typically post-hoc rationalizations. Likewise, hatred is a positive act and not just a reaction, and we likewise look for reasons for a hatred that is fundamentally unreasonable. (We take issue with this assertion, but unfortunately Scheler doesn’t get into enough examples of hatred to give us much specific to chew on here.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes read through and discuss Ch. 6 "Formalism and Person," in Max Scheler's most famous work, &lt;em &gt;Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values &lt;/em &gt;(1916). Ethical Formalism is Kant: What makes something ethically correct is just something about the type of act and willing involved. Non-formalism pays attention to the content, e.g. our sentiments (a la Hume).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As we've been studying on PEL, phenomenologists starting with Brentano sought to merge the two: Things in our experience just present themselves as intuitively praiseworthy, and this is sufficient to establish ethical obligations. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-364-max-on-125400620"&gt;We have been reading about how Scheler &lt;/a &gt;relies in his ethical theorizing on our experiences of sympathy and love, but we wanted to learn more about what it is about particular people that we love and respect: What is it to be a "person" in the moral sense?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This book moves very slowly, so in this part he's still just distinguishing himself from Kant when it comes to saying some basic things about your relation to your own selfhood.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Formalism-In-Ethics-And-Non-formal-Ethics-Of-Values-Max-Scheler.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 370 (PDF p. 403).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as ad-free &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/126788064"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on &lt;em &gt;The Basis of Morality &lt;/em &gt;(1840), Part III: "The Founding of Ethics," Ch. 5: "Statement and Proof of the Only True Moral Incentive."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How can we actually perform moral acts given that we typically feel and so are motivated only by our own "weal and woe?" Schopenhauer insists that we can feel other people's suffering directly (interestingly, not their joy), and so the cardinal virtues are to hold our own predations (and emotional burdens) in check to refrain from harming others (the virtue of justice) and also to positively act to relieve others' suffering (the virtue of compassion). These correspond to Kantian "perfect duty" and "imperfect duty," but Schopenhauer insists that ethics is not founded on duty at all but this fundamentally emotional reaction. However, once we've established through compassion that consideration is owed to others, we should establish ethical principles, i.e. duties and other obligations, so that we continue to act morally even when we don't feel compassionate or just.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://ia600905.us.archive.org/17/items/basisofmorality00schoiala/basisofmorality00schoiala.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 171 (PDF p. 199).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan reconvened for one more hour on Part I, "Fellow Feeling" (ch. 3-4) in &lt;em &gt;The Nature of Sympathy &lt;/em &gt;(1913/1922). Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-364-max-on-125400620"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;of the discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We continue to try to figure out the razor's edge of "fellow feeling proper" that does not rely on the sympathizer identifying in any way (including comparing himself to) to object of sympathy. Ch. 3 ("Genetic Theories of Fellow-Feeling") includes many psychological remarks on various phenomena by which people live through the lives of others or control them (making them identify with the master).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ch. 4 ("Metaphysical Theories") departs from psychology to look at what monist metaphysics is posited according to identification theories like that of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/closereads-on-125678584"&gt;Schopenhauer &lt;/a &gt;. This whole chapter (beyond a short section about Schopenhauer) was added in the second (1922) edition of the book, and one might wonder what the point of its inclusion is here, since this is not a book of metaphysics, Scheler's phenomenological method won't let him rule definitively on one metaphysical system over another (he's just describing our experiences, not the world beyond that realm), and he's already made the point that we have to experience other people as separate in order to non-egoistically feel sympathy with them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I don't know that I have a good answer for that, but this is the chapter where he affirms the "vital unity" between people while denying their metaphysical (spiritual) unity. In other words, we're all part of the animal kingdom, with its strivings and sexual urges and other hungers. Contra Schopenhauer, this does not include inorganic matter; we should not see the movements of gravity and electricity and such as expressions of some fundamental Will. The unity of animal life is sufficient to allow us to identify with other creatures, and it provides the fundamental herd mentality from which we then emerge as individuals (per &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/reissue-ep-35-on-56105230"&gt;Hegel &lt;/a &gt;). Mother and in-utero child are literally the same being, and this identification between them persists to various degrees. Scheler is not denying these phenomena; he's simply saying that they do not explain fellow feeling, which (as we'll get into at the beginning of ep. 365 when we cover the final chapters of Part I) is deepest when aimed not at the external circumstances or animal desires of the other, but when aimed at the person, i.e. the spiritual core. Scheler insists that phenomenology reveals that yes, there is a unity that we can acknowledge and identify with between people on the vital level, but we are absolutely separate as spiritual beings. Each person is an unknowable Other to all others, and in fact the only way we can truly relate to this core is by reference to the one Being that has epistemic access to our innermost selves: God.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Note that this part will be shared with the public on 4/14, which will bump the release of ep. 365 to the following week. We did this to give ourselves more time to read, and because we thought that the material here was important enough that we didn't want anyone to get lost with the next ep. You can tide yourselves over by listening to the relevant Closereads episodes, including &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/closereads-on-124860764"&gt;one on Husserl that &lt;/a &gt;sets up our Scheler treatment and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/closereads-on-125678584"&gt;another on Schopenhauer &lt;/a &gt;that goes into this view that Scheler is objecting to. Spoiler: We find that perhaps Schopenhauer's view is not as different from Scheler's as Scheler is characterizing it. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Basis of Morality &lt;/em &gt;(1840), Part III: "The Founding of Ethics," Ch. 5: "Statement and Proof of the Only True Moral Incentive."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Everything up to this point in the book has been negative: Morality can't be founded on pure reason as Kant thinks, or on the idea of the good life (eudaimonia) per Aristotle. Schopenhauer tells us that all actions are motivated by someone's "weal" or "woe." We are naturally self-interested (motivated by own own weal and woe), but such actions will not be moral. So Schopenhauer's puzzle is: How can I be effectively motivated by someone else's weal and woe? I must somehow identify with that person so that the Other's suffering induces my compassion. This is the only source of moral value.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://ia600905.us.archive.org/17/items/basisofmorality00schoiala/basisofmorality00schoiala.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 165 (PDF p. 193).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as ad-free &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/125678572"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

We look more closely at the text, getting further into how fellow feeling relates to ethics, and why the moral sentimentalists (like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-45-moral-hume-15467492"&gt;Hume &lt;/a &gt;) were wrong about this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also get more into the types of fellow feeling, from "genuine fellow feeling" that takes the other person's mental state as your emotional object, to various kinds of identification and infection, where someone else's feelings cause feelings in you involuntarily and/or due to your considering the other person as someone unified with you. What does it mean to "share a feeling" when we experience something together? Are we not still locked off from each other in isolation, even if we are feeling qualitatively similar things and can feel comfort in that solidarity?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scheler critiques Nietzsche's take on compassion and pity as merely immiserating everyone concerned. Nietzsche might be correct if pity were just a matter of seeing someone's suffering and "catching it" to suffer with them, but according to Scheler, this is backwards: I note that someone is suffering, and this does not make me sad; If this were to happen, I would likely just run away. Instead, my pity for the person, expressed as compassion, makes both of us feel better. (Suffering shared is suffering halved.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We subsequently reconvened to record a part three to this episode, which you should see within the week. We'll then use ep. 365 to treat Part II of the book on love and hatred.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Nature of Sympathy &lt;/em &gt;(1913, expanded 1922), Part I: "Fellow Feeling," Ch. 1-4, featuring Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan. What is it to feel sympathy (or as Scheler repeatedly calls it "fellow feeling") for another person?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scheler was a phenomenologist highly influenced by &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/closereads-on-124860764"&gt;Husserl &lt;/a &gt;and his teacher &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-363-franz-one-124444025"&gt;Brentano &lt;/a &gt;, who immediately before this work had written a lengthy ethical treatise &lt;em &gt;The Formalistic Principle in Ethics and the Non-Formal Ethic of Value &lt;/em &gt;, which argued (like Brentano) that values are real, objective, and clear within our experience. They are not equivalent to any state of feeling, so contra the "sentimentalists" Hume and Smith, ethics does not derive its validity from feelings of sympathy that we actually have.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the contrary, ethics is prior to feelings, and allows us to judge some cases of sympathy as bad (as when we rejoice along with a villain). Moreover, we have some ethical duties to ourselves, so sociality can't be the sole origin of ethics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This current book is thus not precisely an ethical treatise, but more an exploration of the phenomenology of how we can have fellow feeling for each other, getting into the psychology of neighboring relationships and ultimately the metaphysics that Scheler describes as underlying his opponents: Those who think that we only have fellow feeling through an act of identification with another person. I say that I in some sense &lt;em &gt;am &lt;/em &gt;you, and so feel for you. Maybe we are part of a larger cosmic Oneness, or I simply imagine myself "in your shoes." According to Scheler, views like this reduce fellow feeling to an a priori egoism: People only value themselves, and so the only way we can extend our circle of concern is by relating others to ourselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Instead, Scheler argues that fellow feeling is a native ability whereby we directly relate ourselves to another person's mental state. We understand the other person's joy or sorrow, and beyond that, we feel joy or pity toward that person's emotions. This is different from being "infected" by the other person's emotions, such that I'm really still focused on my &lt;em &gt;own &lt;/em &gt;reactions. My emotions could be quite different from yours, and I might not be able to relate directly to the thing that you are emotionally reacting to, because I haven't had that experience, can't even imagine it, and/or don't share the attraction or aversion that is driving your emotion. But I do see that you are emotional about it, and so I "feel for you." It's fundamentally a relation to another person that acknowledges that this person is irreducibly Other to me; this separation does not keep me from sympathizing with you, but on the contrary is the precondition for fellow feeling.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Sympathy-Max-Scheler/dp/0208010203" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Scheler-The-Nature-of-Sympathy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/124444025"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "The Origin of the Knowledge of Right and Wrong" (1889), where starting on section 15, Brentano is getting into how we measure the comparative goodness of goods, actions, and purposes. We know that an action is appropriate if it fits and end we have, but how do we measure the values of ends?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Like Aristotle, Brentano looks to what we actually will as an ultimate end, i.e. eudaimonia (flourishing): the good life. We do not on reflection act ultimately in pursuit of pleasure, nor are we all hopelessly selfish.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;At the same time, Brentano (still like Aristotle) wants morality to be absolute and objective, such that if in a particular society, "common sense" favors cannibalism over kindness, we can reasonably pronounce that society perverted. And Brentano provides us explanations with how some kinds of perversion can occur, such as when a miser through habit comes to see the good of money, which is inherently just a means to other goods, and a good end in itself. Perhaps, comparably, a society of extreme scarcity might develop practices out of necessity like cannibalism, infanticide, or killing old people as soon as they aren't maximally contributing, and then these come to seen as not just unfortunate emergency measures, but as expressing the vital spirit of the society, i.e. as good in themselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Still, there's a tension we're trying to grasp about whether moral intuition is a basic detection capability grasping a sui generis category of goodness, or whether some practice is good because it "works," i.e. whether there are non-moral criteria we can identify that explain why the detector goes off to label some things good and others bad. I think the first of these is likely correct, but that of course, the good that we detect shows signs of its goodness it does in general make things work out for us, just as it also appears beautiful to us and is (presumably) beloved by any gods that might exist, even though these latter characteristics likewise do not &lt;em &gt;define &lt;/em &gt;goodness. As Brentano has told us, evolutionary contingencies also tend to aim societies toward the good, and non-moral prudence tends to aim individuals this way. These things do not provide ultimate moral justifications, but they do help explain why goodness is as prevalent as it is, even among those who lack solid moral intuition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A key characteristic of moral intuitions for Brentano is that they are "summative": the good of a whole will be greater than the good of part. Summation doesn't mean that all forms of goodness can be quantified in the manner of Bentham's utilitarianism; Brentano's position is akin to Mill's, which allows that there are higher and lower pleasures that cannot be quantitatively compared (like the proverbial apples and oranges). Even among lower pleasures, how many tasty French fries is equivalent to an orgasm? The question makes no sense.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But clearly the good of one person is going to have less weight in our moral calculations than the good of many people. We can sensibly legislate based on the greatest good for the greatest number without having any sort of quantitative measure of the good for an individual. Even at the individual level, the good for me at a single moment is obviously less than the eudaimonia of a whole life. And within a conception of eudaimonia, a life with beauty and knowledge together will be superior to a life with just one of those goods.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "The Origin of the Knowledge of Right and Wrong" (1889), featuring Mark, Wes, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Brentano was a descriptive psychologist best known for coming up with the idea that all mental states are "intentional"; they all point at something or other. You have a believe THAT [some proposition], or you perceive [some object or state of affairs], or feel an emotion about [some situation]. This is a key idea behind the subsequent German philosophical school of phenomenology, which claims to describe our experiences in a theory-free way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though that framework does come up in this work, it's a lecture instead about the foundations of ethics in particular, and we're using it to kick off a series on moral phenomenology. Phenomenology in this (or any) area is supposed to be an advance from traditional rationalist and empiricist approaches. Brentano, like the rationalists Plato and Kant, believes that moral truths can be known with the same certainty as mathematical truths; they are objective. But like the empiricists Bentham and Hume, Brentano also believes that morality is given immediately in our experience: in our feelings and observations; it is not a result of some reasoned calculation like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-10-kantian-we-30313369"&gt;Kant's Categorical Imperative &lt;/a &gt;, which Brentano dismisses as a cheat and a fiction, and it's certainly not an innate idea as a Platonist might think of it. But can something given in experience offer the certainty that the rationalists were looking for? (In saying yes, Brentano was also prefiguring G.E. Moore, who both thought that &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-307-g-e-moore-76336587"&gt;everyday knowledge claims could be absolutely certain &lt;/a &gt;and that &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-58-what-moore-17045411"&gt;moral truths are intuitively given &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Brentano is trying to make ethics properly scientific. Scientists tend to give empirical explanations, including genetic accounts of the origins of morality, e.g. it was evolutionarily advantageous for us to cooperate, political authority was psychologically internalized to become conscience, etc. While these stories may be correct as far as the development of humanity goes, they don't actually, for Brentano, provide justification for moral claims. Instead, if we've become by whatever mechanism the kids of creatures to rationally evaluate our situations, these claims are just given to us as evidently true. We can all rationally see, just as we can see that 2+2=4 or that the law of non-contradiction holds, that the good of the many is greater than the good of the few. We can likewise be sure that knowledge is better than ignorance, joy is better than suffering, and so helping people is better than hurting them. The fact that some incompetent, savage, or degraded people might not be able to see this doesn't undercut the evident validity of these facts. The course of evolution and culture has on the whole made us into the kinds of creatures who are open to rational intuition of this sort, but they have not determined what we learn through moral insight, and so a different sort of conditioning wouldn't change these moral facts; it would just make us blind to them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Brentano acknowledges that different rules rightly apply in different societies with different cultural circumstances, but insists that the basic moral principles underlying all of them are universal, that we are all by nature oriented toward the good and apt to come up with the same foundational moral judgments no matter what (sufficiently mature) society we are born into.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Brentano's task then becomes distinguishing between those principles actually given to us by rational intuition from other principles that we simply find ourselves compelled to believe, e.g. through personal habit or acculturation). In the area of general epistemology, we find ourselves naturally compelled to believe when we see a physical object that the object is there, in the external world. But philosophy reveals that this is not something we should be certain about. Per Descartes, we can be certain that there is some content to consciousness, but not that this corresponds to something in the external world. In the area of moral epistemology, we can be sure about fundamental abstract principles, but not about how to best apply them in real situations, when we might be wrong about the facts. For instance, gratitude is always a fitting response to generosity, but how can I tell that someone is actually being generous in this case?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So certain judgments have the character in our experience of "rightness" (not unlike for Descartes they can have the character of clarity and distinctness), and in the moral realm, certain loves have the character that we are rightly loving. Whereas for moral sentimentalism (Hume or Smith), the very fact of our having affection for something is prima facie evidence for its goodness, and all judgments of goodness ultimately have to be founded on real sentiments by real people (compared to each other to make them consistent and rational), Brentano thinks that we are well aware that some of our affections and desires present themselves as "lower" and some as "higher," intrinsically inferior or superior, so, for example, we can tell that the pursuit of pleasure, even though this is someone everyone experiences, is not intrinsically valuable, and certainly not as morally good as the pursuit of meaning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://ia600208.us.archive.org/22/items/theoriginofthekn00brenuoft/theoriginofthekn00brenuoft.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the lecture &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

We make some connection from the author's observations to ancient Greek Skepticism, Epicureanism, and Stoicism. How is the world "absurd" according to this book; is this the same claim we get later from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-4-camus-and-30313112"&gt;Camus &lt;/a &gt;?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Qhoheleth considers the life of pleasure, great accomplishments, and even the philosophical life, and considers them all absurd. At the same time, there are benefits in this life to having wisdom, and we do have the capacity to orient ourselves intelligently given our limitations. Still, this seems overshadowed by the fact of death and the injustice that whatever you accomplish, you can't enjoy it beyond the grave, and inevitably your legacy will be mismanaged, ruined, and forgotten. Given this crushing eventuality, we might as well enjoy our work without an eye for what it accomplishes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next time &lt;/strong &gt;: We're discussing Franz Brentano's lecture “&lt;a href="https://ia800208.us.archive.org/22/items/theoriginofthekn00brenuoft/theoriginofthekn00brenuoft.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Origin of the Knowledge of Right and Wrong &lt;/a &gt;” (1889).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ecclesiastes is often cited as one of the most philosophical books of the Bible, so we approached it in that spirit with the help of &lt;a href="https://www.georgefox.edu/honors-program/faculty-pages/jesse-peterson.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse M. Peterson from George Fox University &lt;/a &gt;, whose soon-to-be-published book is called &lt;em &gt;Qoheleth and the Philosophy of Value &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;First, who is Qoheleth? It’s the Hebrew word typically translated as teacher or preacher (liberally “gatherer” or “assembler,” as in assembling people together to preach to them), which is how the book identifies the purveyor of wisdom in the book. The book also, however, gives details about this person’s life that uniquely pick out the Israelite King Solomon (10th century BCE), so in Bible studies courses, they’ll usually say this is who wrote the book (also purportedly the author of Proverbs and Song of Songs). However, aspects of the language used make it clear to scholars that Ecclesiastes was written much later (maybe 250 BCE), so we should just consider the authorship anonymous.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The book as a whole is highly nihilistic, rejecting daily human work and even the endeavors of powerful, free people as “hebel,” which is often translated as “vanity” but more closely means fleeting (literally “vapor”), meaningless, absurd, or futile. Even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/W4ga_M5Zdn4?si=MUFhp0zeUlSvPeMF" target="_blank"&gt;the famous verses about there being a time for everything under heaven &lt;/a &gt;is not expressing a peaceful sentiment about everything in its due time; it’s mourning the fact that anything good that anyone accomplishes is just going to get undone eventually. The traditional Biblical interpretation of the book is that, yes, this nihilism does follow if you’re only looking to the secular world (“everything under the sun”) for comfort, but God’s supernatural presence makes it all better. For various reasons we get into in the podcast, this is probably a bad reading: &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-evidence-that-the-end-of-Ecclesiastes-is-a-later-addition-12-13-14-Is-there-any-manuscript-evidence-or-is-just-it-a-supposed-difference-of-tone-I-am-interested-in-what-the-strongest-arguments-for-it-are" target="_blank"&gt;Scholars are pretty sure &lt;/a &gt;that the end of the book that most directly makes this point was added by a later author to make the whole thing more palatable. Though the existence of God is not in question in the text, and there are positive points within it that urge us to enjoy the time we’ve been given (by God), these elements are already taken into account when the world is judged as hebel.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes this particularly existential is the emphasis on death: Whatever great deeds you accomplish, you’re just going to die, and everyone who might remember you will die to, so it’s ultimately all for nothing. Importantly, there’s no indication in the book that yes, actually you and many others will live on in heaven, so we just need to get through this temporary, meaningless life to get to where it’ll all be made right.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So we all die, and the author’s reaction to this says something about how death is considered to be a harm and what would make life meaningful, if anything could, i.e. if our accomplishments could make a lasting social impact, which clearly this author’s did, even if we don’t know who he was! But according to the text, it would still be a point of annoyance with him that we future people now own his text when we didn’t work to create it, and undoubtedly we’ll for the most part muck it up in translating, interpreting, and trying to apply its wisdom to our lives.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://ebible.org/pdf/eng-web/eng-web_ECC.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the NRSV Bible version of Ecclesiastes that we read &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Qoheleth-Philosophy-Value-Jesse-Peterson/dp/1009513257/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W32JXXMK6022 &amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.--mt1ph25QnEGiEeDsqfJv7hkIdb8sRevhM55TQ5EvrAc3ap8hVb0qCbuuDXvfRE.djTmt3NLhPfVQ8zJwrQ04d2AWAICcJaLj89PbkIM4q0 &amp;amp;dib_tag=se &amp;amp;keywords=jesse+peterson+Qoheleth &amp;amp;qid=1740428045 &amp;amp;sprefix=jesse+peterson+qoheleth%2Caps%2C112 &amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse’s book is forthcoming and looks to be priced strictly for academic library purchases &lt;/a &gt;, but maybe you can recommend that your library get a copy. We concentrated on ch. 2 and 3 of that book, the first of which had to do with “hebel” and draws heavily on an article Jesse recommends: “&lt;a href="https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/sblpress/jbl/article-abstract/105/3/409/192250/The-Meaning-of-Hebel-for-Qohelet" target="_blank"&gt;The Meaning of Hebel for Qohelet &lt;/a &gt;” by Michael V. Fox (1986). Ch. 3 went through different theories on why death is bad. Jesse’s later chapters talked more about the positive messages in Ecclesiastes, but we didn’t read those, so our take remains pessimistic.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Guattari was a Lacanian psychotherapist, and he argues for explaining fascist tendencies via a "micropolitics of desire," i.e. looking at the individual psychology of fascism instead of merely focusing on sociological, material causes of the rise of fascism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.revue-chimeres.fr/IMG/pdf/everybody-wants-to-be-a-fascist.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/gold-and-brown" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the the John Ganz blog Wes refers to &lt;/a &gt;at the end, and &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-does-everyone-want-to-be-a-fascist-guattaris/id1512615438?i=1000688993103" target="_blank"&gt;the episode of Acid Horizon &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The image was lifted from &lt;a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Felix-Guattari-Philosophy-by-isstgeschichte/153242888.EJUG5" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;; go buy this guy's merch.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as ad-free &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/122576188"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;To conclude our Marx treatment, we continue from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/122447457"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, finally getting into his "Fragment on Machines" (1858). Shouldn't automating work free the workers? No! According to Marx, the (then-current) process of automation actually just makes labor conditions worse and certainly doesn't give people more free time, as the capitalist inevitably takes all the gains from greater productivity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk machines vs. instruments, why mechanization is inevitable according to Marx, the relation of machines to social knowledge, and how AI might fit into all of this, and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;, we're discussing Ecclesiastes, the Biblical book written around 250 BCE by an unknown author who presents himself (or his main narrator) as King Solomon.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yet more time spent on Karl Marx finishes up our treatment of &lt;em &gt;Capital &lt;/em &gt;, Ch. 1, and throws in the mix "Fragment on Machines" (1858), which we'll discuss explicitly in part two of this. You should probably listen to our Marx series first, starting with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2025/01/17/ep359-1-marx-grundrisse-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 359 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;em &gt;Capital &lt;/em &gt;, we finally get to the little bit that Marx says about actual communism, where there are no commodities (just as there aren't under feudalism or within a family structure); there's production, but not for the purpose of money exchange. Marx is so tight-lipped about this because he is wary of utopian thinking, despite communism being reputed as a type of utopianism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So we have to think through some issues ourselves: Is sophisticated manufacturing even possible without capital, and is (&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/09/07/ep123-1-economics/" target="_blank"&gt;problematic &lt;/a &gt;) central planning required? Would getting rid of capitalism actually change our understanding of ourselves, such that we would voluntarily cooperate and not just lazily mooch off the system (because we're driven by appetite) or compete even more fiercely with others (because we're driven by thymos)?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/TheFragmentOnMachinesKarlMarx" target="_blank"&gt;Read "Fragment on Machines" online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding on Marx's "The German Ideology" (1846), now giving Marx's positive alternative to Max Stirner's account of the self-delusion of ordinary folks. Whereas Stirner thinks they have this false dichotomy between selfishness (bad) and selflessness (good) and should instead embrace enlightened self-interest as good, Marx thinks that all these ideas are a result of economic circumstances, i.e. ideology. Consequently Stirner can't, according to Marx, truly understand communism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://dn790007.ca.archive.org/0/items/germanideologymarxengels/German%20Ideology%20Marx%20Engels.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 264 (PDF p. 260).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Capital &lt;/em &gt;(1867), Ch. 1, "The Commodity." This continues our discussion in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-359-karl-part-120219712"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;introducing Marx's economic project. So how does one begin to explain a holistic system? Marx chooses to start with wealth, i.e. the thing Adam Smith was trying to explain in &lt;em &gt;The Wealth of Nations &lt;/em &gt;, and wealth, for Marx, is represented in the commodity: stuff that we buy and sell.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what makes a commodity valuable? Clearly, we each have different needs, and so a particular commodity will have different values for each of us (a different "use value"), but in the aggregate, the overall need for something as expressed in the willingness of someone to pay a certain amount for it determines its exchange value, and in this way, even though the uses of, e.g. a bunch of grapes and an iphone are different, we can measure the exchange value of one (at a given time in a given market) in terms of the other, and ultimately, we use a third thing, money, as the medium for making it obvious that any commodity can (in the right quantity) be in effect traded for any other.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So does this mean that value as abstracted over different consumers is just entirely a matter of demand, that commodities have no economic value in themselves? No, this is the error that Marx things political economists have fallen into. Marx thinks we need to look beneath the commodity into its production and locates its value in the labor that went into it. This is the "labor theory of value": Even though many things can be useful without any labor (you go out in your yard and the trees are just teeming with fruit waiting to be plucked), if something is a commodity, the difficulty of getting that fruit (or whatever) to market, and so the underlying value of that commodity, is a matter of how much effort it takes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Marx makes it immediately clear that this not a matter of how much labor an individual producer puts in, such that someone weaker and slower has to put in more labor and so creates a more valuable product. Instead, Marx talks about the "socially necessary labor" that typically goes into a type of product, which is an average across producers. So if one producer is more efficient (e.g. gets a fruit-picking machine), that provides a temporary advantage for that producer, but typically any such innovation will spread through the industry, and so a new equilibrium will be reached.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This idea of socially necessary labor grounds his notion (not in this chapter) of surplus value: X hours are needed for a worker of average ability in a given industry to produce enough of a commodity to pay for his own salary, and everything beyond that is surplus, which ideally should be shared between the capitalist and the worker, but in practice goes entirely to the capitalist, and in fact the capitalist will make the worker work as many more hours as possible beyond that necessary labor amount to increase the capitalist's share. This is his fundamental critique: Capitalists are incentivized to exploit workers to maximize the return on investment. This means that even if a capitalist is very socially aware and generous in his private dealings, the majority of the way that his life concretely affects people is through this exploitation. We think we're just looking at business, at the market, at "what makes the world go round," but this "commodity fetishism" makes us overlook the laborers providing the value that makes commodities possible, and justice demands that the exploitation stop.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/capitalvol1" target="_blank"&gt;Read Capital online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We continue from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/120219712"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on the introduction to the &lt;em &gt;Grundrisse &lt;/em &gt;(1857), which is essentially a set of notes written in the composition of his major work, &lt;em &gt;Capital &lt;/em &gt;, which we'll deal with explicitly in ep. 360.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What exactly is universal and natural about our economic patterns, and what is a matter of historical epoch? Marx claims we can't just see the distribution of goods and a historical accident but then see production and consumption as natural. Instead, all of these things are related, with the means of production aligning with (not "determining"; the causality is as of parts within a system) how people consume and how goods are distributed to them. Private property is not as Locke saw it something natural, rooted in our control of our own bodies, but is specific to capitalism: Our relationship to our bodies, or to our personal possessions (my clothes, my home), and the sort of ownership that people within a family or tribe have to their belongings, is different than our modern take on private property, where the state backs private ownership of even vast things, and no matter how much you use a resource (e.g. Locke theorized that land becomes owned when one works it), that doesn't give you any legal right to it if it started as someone else's. Key to modern private property is the idea that everything owned is potentially exchangeable, and so convertible into a government-backed currency.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How are production and consumption related in capitalism? A worker needs to consume (e.g. food and clothing) in order to be alive to produce, and what is produced creates consumers (including that same worker) who are adapted to consume certain products. So producers are consumers and vice versa; we are related to ourselves in these two roles via the mediation of exchange with others; this is essentially Hegel's story of self-consciousness, turned from something having to do with mind (I recognize myself through your recognition of me) into something having to do with people's actions, whatever those people might think of them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Were I putting songs at the ends of these episodes still, "&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cOeKidp-iWo?si=2LoCVqVauVZA0M1f" target="_blank"&gt;The Way it Is &lt;/a &gt;" by &lt;a href="https://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem209-bruce-hornsby/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music guest Bruce Hornsby &lt;/a &gt;would be my selection: The inequalities and economic patterns of our present are neither given by nature, nor are they unchangeable!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the introduction to Marx's &lt;em &gt;Grundrisse &lt;/em &gt;, aka &lt;em &gt;Foundations of a Critique of Political Economy &lt;/em &gt;(1857) with an appetizer of "Theses on Feuerbach" (1845). This is the first of three discussions we'll be having on Marx's "mature" work, and we were also assigned the first chapter (and introduction and 2nd edition afterward) of his &lt;em &gt;Capital &lt;/em &gt;(1867), though we're not going to get around to talking about that much until ep. 360.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To transition us from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-355-marx-on-116083442"&gt;Marx's earlier work &lt;/a &gt;influenced by &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-356-feuerbach-117110226"&gt;Feuerbach &lt;/a &gt;, we start with this very short bullet-list paper that argues that Feuerbach, by continuing to write about religion and the life of the mind, is still being too abstract, whereas Marx was shifting his focus entirely to economics, and his goal was both to write a theoretical treatise that would improve on the analyses of earlier political economists, but also to make a real difference in the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These two goals were of course not unrelated. Though Marx had a great deal of respect for Adam Smith and David Ricardo, he characterized the followers of these economists as mere mouthpieces for business concerns. In &lt;em &gt;Capital &lt;/em &gt;, Marx aimed to show that most of the wealth we possess comes directly from labor (the "labor theory of value," invented by Smith and developed by Ricardo), and that yet capitalists are incentivized to pay as little as possible to workers for their labor. According to his analysis, laborers typically produce value equivalent to their wages in just a few hours, and the rest of their day is spent creating surplus value, all of which goes to the capitalist. Marx saw this situation as fundamentally unjust and ultimately unsustainable.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A key element in this critique (and a difference Marx seems to see between himself and Feuerbach) is historical perspective. Capitalist economists starting with Smith (and even back to the Greeks) see division of labor and consequent trade as a natural part of being human, and the economy as essentially an outgrowth of nature. Marx argues that most of supposed natural economic laws are merely laws reflecting the logic of the particular historical moment of capitalism. So for instance, the idea of a social contract (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau) presupposes that there are isolated, self-contained individuals who join together in political and economic activity, whereas Marx argues that this view of individualism reflects the situation of serfs recently freed from a collapsed feudal order, ready to then engage in "free" contracts of employment. Marx instead follows Hegel in seeing ancient humanity as a herd-like mass, with societies established by acts of domination, and economic exchange not coming into play originally between individuals, who are instead units within families and/or master/slave situations, but between such groups.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To present a picture of real-world economic dynamics that would help us to direct practical reforms is fundamentally different than the normative ideal-building that philosophy traditionally engages in. Marx describes this erection of ideals, even when done using strictly secular means, as self-alienating. Simply saying that capitalists ought to be more compassionate or that workers should adopt Stoic ethics is a hopeless strategy for achieving change in worker's material conditions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the &lt;em &gt;Grundrisse &lt;/em &gt;, Marx gives us a systems approach to economics, where production, consumption, distribution, and exchange are all part of the same process, and so can't be studied in isolation, as (he alleges) other economists are doing by focusing on supply and demand (i.e. exchange). Still, however, Marx tells us that production is the primary moment of this unified process; we'll go into why in part two of this discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read "Theses on Feuerbach" online &lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;and the &lt;em &gt;Grundrisse &lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/grundrisse.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/119266665"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;The Ego and Its Own &lt;/em &gt;, focusing now on the sections "The Owner" and "My Power." Stirner lets us know that his egoism ("ownness") is not compatible with liberal egalitarianism, which he sees as just a continuation of the Christian project of perfecting humanity. He calls liberalism the religion of free states.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The humanist emphasis on what Feuerbach and Marx (following Kant) called "species being" is to Stirner just an unwarranted focus on one property that we have, our species, which is less important to us than our unique qualities. As a proto-existentialist, Stirner does not believe that there is a thing called human nature. My ownness, my activity, determines my being.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Anticipating Nietzsche and Freud, Stirner says that society goes against our instinctual nature and typically damages us as individuals. For Stirner, the notion of "right" is fundamentally social, not a way of protecting individuality but a cage for it. We only really have a right to what we have power over, because there is no God or other agency that endows us with rights; we have to claim them ourselves. This all sounds like a state of nature argument, but without the idea that a social contract is a good escape from it. We &lt;em &gt;never &lt;/em &gt;escape from it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what positive vision comes out of this? It's hard to tell, and that was frustrating. Let us know what you think!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Episode &lt;/strong &gt;: For eps. 359-360, we're returning to Marx, reading the introduction to the &lt;em &gt;Grundrisse &lt;/em &gt;(1857) and the first bits of &lt;em &gt;Das Kapital &lt;/em &gt;(1867).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing our trip through Marx and his influences, Wes, Dylan, and Seth read &lt;em &gt;The Ego and its Own &lt;/em &gt;(1844), also translated as &lt;em &gt;The Unique and its Property &lt;/em &gt;. Max Stirner was the pen name of Johann Kaspar Schmidt, and he went farther than Feuerbach in rejecting the status quo of a society driven by religion and traditional morality, prefiguring Nietzsche (though Nietzsche was aware of Stirner, there's no evidence that he read this book). After giving an overview, we mainly concentrate here on a section of the book called "Ownness."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He explicitly embraces a "might makes right" philosophy against the Christian tradition and equally rejects socialism and communism, sort of like an early Ayn Rand. His ideal is someone focused on "ownness" (i.e. egoism), which sounds like a precursor to Nietzsche's Overman, though a more nihilistic version of this (no living artistically).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Like Feuerbach, Stirner critically traces the history of philosophy through idealism to Hegel and rejects these latter developments of failing to escape the flaws of Christianity itself. But by embracing "species being," Feuerbach is on Stirner's account still a crypto-theologian, placing "Man" as fundamentally transcendent ideal above individuals. Unlike the social contract tradition that describes political life as an achievement of civilized humanity, Stirner argues that our excellence as human beings is to grow beyond our social (herdlike) origins. Even though the result is anarchism, he doesn't argue for this on the basis of personal freedom, he thinks is a notion that is actually derivative of moral right. It's not enough to be merely free from interference; we want to be &lt;em &gt;owners &lt;/em &gt;. Being free in a liberal society really means being obedient to the law, so that &lt;em &gt;everyone &lt;/em &gt;can be free of others' incursions. Freedom is only worth something, for Stirner, if you've &lt;em &gt;earned &lt;/em &gt;it through exertion of your own power. To really be an egoist, you'll be a criminal, an enemy of the state without concern for others' rights. So basically, in rejecting the tyranny of morality, he's embracing the position of &lt;a href="https://iep.utm.edu/thrasymachus/" target="_blank"&gt;Thracymachus &lt;/a &gt;in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-40-platos-is-15462680"&gt;Plato's Republic &lt;/a &gt;. "Justice" or any other word referring to the good of the collective is just nonsense; there's just us as individuals with our individual interests.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the sections we read, he doesn't go into what this post-justice society would look like, but he says that animals don't need a government, so we shouldn't either. We also don't get much of a "therapy of desire" approach where we can use the book to optimize how we order and regulate our own wishes. Instead, we get a lot of negative talk about weaklings who are controlled by "conscience." A strong person will use the means at his disposal to get what he wants (which presumably includes violence, though again, he doesn't explicitly address this).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://files.libcom.org/files/Stirner_The_Ego_and_Its_Own.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the book online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on 12/21/24, Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan reflect on our past year of PEL recording, catch you up on our habits and interests, and talk about what might come next. Happy Holidays and thanks for your support!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our strategy here was just to look through our list of episodes starting in January when we were finishing up Kierkegaard, then worked our way through Aristotle, re-visited two types of non-Western philosophy, and more. We get into many of our ongoing concerns such as how much secondary literature we should be reading, whether we should do interviews, whether people like how we’re now dwelling longer on single works/authors instead of just hitting it once and moving on. How has Closereads bled into PEL? What did Mark discover in teaching Big Books in Continental Philosophy this fall that can redirect PEL’s selections? How do people’s varying work schedules and general business affect our tolerance for certain authors? Are we getting more nihilistic as we age, and how should you pronounce “nihilism,” anyway?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude by talking about politics given that we hadn’t weighed in on the election since it happened. What could we read in the future that would help us make sense of what’s going on now?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also, RIP &lt;a href="https://www.sjc.edu/news/eva-brann-beloved-tutor-emerita-and-former-annapolis-dean-dies-age-95" target="_blank"&gt;Eva Brann &lt;/a &gt;, one of our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/?s=eva+brann" target="_blank"&gt;favorite guests &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Scheduling note &lt;/strong &gt;: We recorded this after Stirner, but we’re taking up a full week of our release schedule to make this publicly available, which means the Stirner discussion you might be waiting for will instead go up closer to next week. You can tide yourself over by listening to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/husserl-on-audio-118885820" target="_blank"&gt;the latest Closereads &lt;/a &gt;, and maybe just start reading Plato’s Death of Socrates dialogues in preparation for the first session of Mark’s &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/core-texts-spring-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;Core Texts in Philosophy class &lt;/a &gt;. The latest &lt;a href="https://prettymuchpop.com/2024/12/23/pmp187-santa-claus/" target="_blank"&gt;Pretty Much Pop on Santa Claus &lt;/a &gt;was strangely philosophical, in a fun way. The latest &lt;a href="https://philosophyimprov.com/pvi87-mysticism-simon-critchley/" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy vs. Improv features a long-sought philosophy guest &lt;/a &gt;, though perhaps not discussing the most philosophical topic in the most philosophical way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;A week after our final public discussion of Feuerbach’s “Principles of the Philosophy of the Future," Mark, Wes, and a re-joining Seth met to talk about sections 23-28 of the essay, which detail Feuerbach's case against Hegel.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Interestingly, F argues that Hegel's treatment of everything, including God, as Idea is given right in the ontological argument: If God's existence is proven by His causation of the idea of God in us, that means God is in the realm of the Idea.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;F finds the notion of God as idea just grasping everything else as also ideas inadequate. There has to be something fundamentally other than God (or Subject generally) that the Subject grasps for the whole relation to have any substance. Only sensuousness (matter) can provide the contrast needed.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, the result is not an insistence on mind-matter dualism, but on moving everything, including God, into the category of sensuous matter. Because objects (many objects, anyway) have forms (it's a dog or a sphere or whatever), this counts in that object as a logos, i.e. mentality. This sounds very much like functionalism in modern philosophy of mind: Thinking or consciousness is not some special mental substance, but a form of organization and activity in matter, so certain complex organizations of matter will count as mind, which can then recognize likeness in each other (Man recognizing himself and others as species being) and/or grasp each other as objects. When a human senses another human, we get both of these things: the grasping of an objectified Other which in turn enables a recognition of the common species and a consequent enrichment of self-knowledge: You are a person and so I am too!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But do we really want to say with F that every object is in fact a subject? Even if we don't want to say that a ball, because it's round, literally has a mind (something that determines the lawlike character of its roundness), F still may be a panpsychist: the ball qua being in space and time has a "perspective" on me and everything else around it, and these raw perspectives are the proto-conscious elements in his metaphysics that allows us to eventually have full-on consciousness. ...Or maybe we're reading all these modern ideas into F, and his metaphysics is simply underbaked!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We finally discuss Feuerbach's proposed new (post-Hegelian) approach to philosophy in his “Principles of the Philosophy of the Future” (1843). Listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/118020676"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;first, and probably before that, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-356-feuerbach-117110226"&gt;ep. 356 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;It probably doesn't sound that "futuristic" to us to claim that "My philosophy actually deals with real things in the world, with matter, whereas the old philosophy was just mind eating itself!" But the point here is to see how the dominance of idealism in Germany could have led then to figures like Marx and Nietzsche. We still get much more negation-of-the past in this Feuerbach essay than we get specific, positive philosophical assertions about justice, truth, and other traditional philosophical concerns.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Matter is something that must act as a limit on a knower. This is the basic phenomenological insight: Every perception is of &lt;em &gt;something &lt;/em &gt;, and this something can't be just the same as the perceiver or the perceiving act. Even when thinking of a mathematical equation, its truth is something objective, independent of a person thinking it. According to F, if both the thinker and the mathematical object were just "thought," the two wouldn't really be distinguished, so materialism (as F understands it) must be just given right there in the phenomenology of perception and even thought. Concluding based on this that a mathematical truth must be fundamentally material seems a bit slipshod, but this is the clearest F gets about this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though F does not actually talk about math here, he does talk about the self, about love, and other intangibles as things that we directly sense. One might think that love is abstract, that it's conceptually loaded, but F claims that there's an immediately sensible core that presumably even animals without concepts can grasp, and F refers to "genius" as the ability to grasp (and convey) profound things in an immediate way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, he describes the fundamental thing we sense is "here-being," which means that sensing something as real means sensing it in a particular place. So not only is space (which implies matter as opposed to nebulous "spirit") central, so space in relation to you the perceiver, i.e. place. So F is again prefiguring a phenomenologist like Heidegger (and earlier Bergson) by prioritizing subjective space (and time) over the kind of space and time that science uses, where space is cut into standard, equal increments and no position in space is privileged. In sum, by insisting that reality is fundamentally sensuous, F transforms the idea of what it is to be sensuous to include a richer notion of reality than the one associated with philosophers like Descartes, Locke, and Hume, preparing the way for this move to be articulated by the phenomenologists 50+ years later.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading selections from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ego_and_Its_Own" target="_blank"&gt;The Ego and Its Own &lt;/a &gt;(1844) by Max Stirner, another key influence on Karl Marx, whom we'll get back to with ep. 359.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We’re continuing to look at Ludwig Feuerbach’s essay “Principles of the Philosophy of the Future” (1843). Now past his critique of theology in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-356-feuerbach-117110226"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;, Mark, Wes, and Dylan address F’s account of the history of philosophy from theism to pantheism to idealism to Hegelianism, and finally to F’s own “philosophy of the future,” which is a materialism that naturally flows out as the correction of Hegel’s system. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In a very Hegelian manner, F posits each of these stages as a corrective on the preceding. If traditional theologians really understood what they were doing and wanted to make their notion of God as all-encompassing consistent, then they’d make it include nature a la Spinoza’s pantheism. If Spinoza really knew what he was doing, then he’d have incorporated Hegel’s insight that God should be the Subject of experience and not just a special kind of object that has mentality as one of its aspects. And if Hegel really knew what he was doing, he’d realize that by making matter itself part of an all-encompassing Subject, then you’ve removed the distinction between matter and mind and should instead of calling the whole system Spirit (mind), just acknowledge that you’re talking fundamentally about matter: God (i.e. everything) is material, or more precisely sensual. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He doesn’t want to define matter a la Descartes as essentially extension, as this would be an abstraction. Matter is instead whatever it is that we sense in its wholeness on a daily basis, including things like love. Feuerbach doesn’t really explain what this means metaphysically, e.g. for the philosophy of mind (How are “ideas” matter? Because they’re brain states?). He does make it clear that there must be real multiplicity for relationships (e.g. between God and creation) to be meaningful; God can’t just be thinking Himself as is the case on Hegel’s account. If when a mind grasps some bit of matter, it’s just mind grasping mind, then the whole thing would lack reality, vanishing in metaphysical smoke.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Feuerbach’s sensual “philosophy of the future” strikes us as proto-phenomenological, in that the world that our senses take in is not the bare appearances of empiricists like Locke and Hume (e.g. a swatch of red), but is more holistic, including cultural matters. We sense (experience) the world as included and shaped by other people, nature as a home. We do not just experience sense-data and have to make conclusions about the real existence of entities causing those data, but we experience real entities in the a world that we are inextricably embedded in (yes, F prefigures Heidegger’s being-in-the-world).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss that new, alternative philosophy (the end of the essay) in part two of this discussion, then we reconvened (minus Dylan, plus Seth) later for a part three recording to cover in depth F’s specific critique of Hegel (which comes at the end of this history-of-philosophy story).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We dig in and start our detailed treatment of Ludwig Feuerbach’s essay “Principles of the Philosophy of the Future” (1843). &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/117110226"&gt;Hear our overview in part one &lt;/a &gt;. This is a very long essay, so we'll continue going through its various sections in ep. 357.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this discussion, we largely keep to his critique of theology, which are the first 11 (out of 65) sections. Feuerbach claims that people don't realize that the entity they worship is really just whatever it is about humanity and the world that we value, wrongly posited as an independent entity. So God is a mirror for any given society: We depict what we take to be the essence of the human condition, the perfection of whatever we see to be our most distinctive qualities, whether that be love or justice or physical strength or whatever. While this sounds like (and Feuerbach describes it as) anthropology, he seems to want to retain what's good about religion: He wants us to worship, particularly through the medium of other people, and to value what's great about ourselves. This is also the time of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-102-emerson-33200505"&gt;Emerson &lt;/a &gt;, so the notion that we should all celebrate ourselves as divine was in the air; Feuerbach is perhaps just a bit more honest about this sort of view being atheistic when seen from the traditional point of view.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ludwig Feuerbach’s essay “Principles of the Philosophy of the Future” (1843) as well as the introduction to his book &lt;em &gt;The Essence of Christianity &lt;/em &gt;(1841). Featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Feuerbach is known primarily for his early influence on Karl Marx. Conventional wisdom has it that Marx took elements of Hegel (e.g. his historical determinism) but rejected Hegel's emphasis on ideas in favor of concrete historical conditions. Feuerbach was also a critic of Hegel and gave Marx some of the key terms in his early work such as "species being."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're breaking our treatment of this figure into two discussions. In this first one, we talk about Feuerbach's revolution in religion, wherein he transforms it into anthropology. Though we have some disagreement about whether to call F. an atheist (as Marx surely was), he was expressly against theology: traditional types of religion that externalize God, and this God is then analyzed by theologians to try to make it make sense. F. describes religion as an authentic activity in the childhood of humanity whereby we take whatever it is we value (chiefly about ourselves, but also about nature and other things) and externalize it into an object of worship. So you can tell a lot about the values of a society by the character of its gods. F. of course wants us to keep on valuing appropriate things, and approves of the passion and dedication that go into religious practice, but he wants us to pierce the fundamental illusion of religion that this object of worship is anything other than the sensible world, including and especially ourselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So religion is basically an emotional act, and philosopher/theologians just make religion less religious by trying to make their idea of God rational. Monotheism itself reflects an intolerant, jealous disposition, and F. saw Judaism as an egoistic elevation of the believing community. All faith is putting a litmus test of belief above the moral qualities (love) that should really be the focus of Christianity. So already the religion that Medieval and modern philosophy are dealing with is highly flawed. In attempting to get over the superstition of common believers, theological philosophers like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-101-on-god-33200446"&gt;Maimonides &lt;/a &gt;and Aquinas stress that God is so great that He doesn't have any properties that we could understand; we can only truly speak of what He is not. For F., this removes the guts of religion; we're now no longer worshipping the best in humanity but an abstract nothing. The "philosopher's God" of Descartes, et al., is just defined abstractly as "the greatest possible being" and "the first cause of the universe." Against these views, F. praises the move of Spinoza to metaphysically rejoin our world with the Divine, and further praises Hegel for making Spinoza's God-as-Nature back into a thinking Subject, still somehow merged with us as in Spinoza's picture. So Hegel's religious philosophy, on F.'s account, is the best that philosophy has offered us modern people so far, but F. criticizes Hegel as wrongly seeing sensuous matter as just part of this world of Divine Thought. Actually, we should see this whole complex (God and world) as necessarily material, because only something that exists at a time and place with real properties actually exists at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the end result is that we can think of ourselves as still religious (or "spiritual") in a loose sense, but our action should be directed at real people in the real world. It's this latter part that Marx ran with in devising his world-helping, thoroughly materialist system.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what does this materialism mean for interpreting, for instance, mathematics? Feuerbach presages phenomenology in expanding the idea of experienced sensuous reality to include meanings, universals, and social entities.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Both of these selections are contained in &lt;a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/2282-the-fiery-brook?srsltid=AfmBOopx5t6JWrPrmTn5nzETZ0_Fp-vRZ-HRl0zhYg9_uhDzjyXLgl9e" target="_blank"&gt;The Fiery Brook: Selected Writings &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/feuerbach/works/future/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Read the main essay online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Learn about Mark's spring Core Texts in philosophy class at &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/class." target="_blank"&gt;partiallyexaminedlife.com/class.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

We want to fix our relationship with nature, which would involve fixing alienation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we get more of a picture of how humans would change under this new system: We would be acting in an authentically social manner, involving species being, i.e. self-consciousness.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Sartre concludes that Nothingness is parasitic upon yet conceptually and metaphysically separate from Being.

Sartre argues that non-being is not a product of human judgment, but something we discover, objectively in our world amidst being. In Ch. 3, he contrasts his view with that of Hegel, who argued that Being and Nothingness are basically identical, in that they are part of the same concept, introduced at the same time (like two sides of a coin or yin/yang).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://ia801504.us.archive.org/14/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.69160/2015.69160.Jean-paul-Sartre-Being-And-Nothingness_text.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 42, i.e. PDF p. 93.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Alienation might even be an inevitable historical development, in that our nature is to work, and efficiency of division of labor is going to give rise to these alienated work situations, even before capitalism comes on the scene. Even more radically, arguably for Marx, the very fact that work creates an external product at all means it's already alienated: we have externalized part of ourselves into a product that by its very separateness is likely to become something alien.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another point Marx makes is that a necessary part of full-bore alienation is that the worker is oppressed not merely by the need to provide for his needs, i.e. by nature, but by another person: the capitalist. Is this really essential given the way I've characterized alienation above?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We finish up by considering a couple of Marx's arguments against other socialist thinkers who he thinks don't really solve the problem of alienation. A good sign of how we're doing as a society in that respect is how relations between men and women are typically structured: Are these fulfilling for all parties, or fundamentally exploitative?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the supporter-only part three of this discussion, we get deep into the text of Marx's positive account psychology post-alienation in "Private Property and Communism."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;For ep. 356 &lt;/strong &gt;: We'll be discussing Ludwig Feuerbach's “Principles of the Philosophy of the Future” (1843), and the introduction to his book &lt;em &gt;The Essence of Christianity &lt;/em &gt;(1841).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On three of Karl Marx's &lt;em &gt;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 &lt;/em &gt;, "Estranged Labor," "Private Property and Communism," and "The Power of Money on Bourgeois Society." The full foursome are joined by &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/?s=dallman" target="_blank"&gt;returning guest &lt;/a &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lawrencedallman.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Dallman &lt;/a &gt;, who now teaches at Bryn Mawr College.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What exactly is the plight of the poor? It's not just that they don't have money, says Marx, and while the institution of money adds a particular flavor of dehumanization to our world, Marx argues (against other social theorists of his time) that even getting rid of all private property wouldn't address the root of the problem, which is human alienation from our work. If you take the initiative to create something, using your own resources, and you get to enjoy the result (whether we're talking about food or shoes or artworks), then that's great. When your instead sell your labor, aren't a full participant in the creative process, and you don't own either the product or the tools you're using to make it, then that's bad.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Marx (following Hegel) describes our relationship to ourselves as mediated by the objects we work on, so while creating authentically allows us to externalize something of ourselves that we can then look upon and understand ourselves, creating something in an alienated manner doesn't do this, and in fact we lose contact with (are alienated from) ourselves. Also, this relationship of boss to worker and even those between workers are degraded by this relationship; we're alienated from real social relationships that would, again, serve to help us reflect on ourselves and so develop ourselves as individuals. Using a term from Feuerbach (whom we'll cover in ep. 355), Marx says that what makes us human is our awareness of our "species-being," our essence as humanity. Animals don't have this, and if we sell all of our time into this inflexible system that isolates us, then we are reduced to the level of animals.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 10-15-24, so before the election (which we do not talk about), Mark, Wes, and Seth instead start talking about horror media and what scares us in light of Halloween. We then give some follow-up discussion re. our Williamson and Chappell interviews. Do we actually want to participate in Williamson's science-minded analytic philosophy of the future? &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Were we too one-sided in our trans coverage? We respond to an email about our trans episode, and we get to at last hear Wes weigh in on the topic, even though he did not participate in or even listen to our interview with her or our subsequent discussion (and keeps here inadvertently referring to her as "Chappelle").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/hD3w_VdTG30?si=BHebffcLwTM1C-XX" target="_blank"&gt;Here's that Austin Powers scene Mark refers to &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

So what does that involve, exactly? Tim says some things about what public philosophy can and can't do. Philosophers should get out of their armchairs and connect to the scientific results and tools of the day.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Some of our final discussion concerns ethical theories and how extreme or personal "counter-evidence" should be dealt with (e.g. you might be against capital punishment, but what about the killer of your own family?).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Oxford philosophy professor Timothy Williamson talks to Mark, Wes, and Seth about his new book, &lt;em &gt;Overfitting and Heuristics in Philosophy &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How can we best apply the insights of philosophy of science to philosophy itself? Beginning with his earlier book &lt;a href="https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/The-Philosophy-of-Philosophy-by-Timothy-Williamson/9781119616689?gad_source=1 &amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwm5e5BhCWARIsANwm06hnYVxFq3XICOCLp2dbX2AOx7LR-9aYJ49B69k35CVGfHVRLgpiHjEaAr-WEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;The Philosophy of Philosophy &lt;/a &gt;, Tim has argued that the way philosophy uses alleged counter-examples to refute philosophical theories is naïve. The philosophy of science has moved past &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-82-karl-on-w-27513246"&gt;Popper's &lt;/a &gt;theory that a single experiment against a theory amounts to a refutation; there's always a choice whether to change the theory fundamentally, to revise just some peripheral aspect of it relevant to the experiment, or deny the validity or relevance of the experiment. Tim claims this should be applied to philosophy too: When a thought experiment produces alleged counter-evidence to the theory, we should try to figure out the source of the intuitions make the thought experiment look tempting. The first chapter of Tim's new book outlines several heuristics that people use to generate intuitions and how these heuristics can at times produce bad data.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the arena of perception, for instance, a heuristic tells us (and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-352-thomas-on-113513216"&gt;Thomas Reid &lt;/a &gt;does too!) that when we see something, we take this perception as veridical. This usually works, but in cases of perceptual illusion (a straight stick looking bent when placed in water, a desert mirage), it doesn't. This doesn't mean we throw away the heuristic and become skeptics, but we have to be careful and try to diagnose what went wrong with the perceptual-environmental system in cases where the heuristic results in faulty belief.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;That was an example of where the failure of a heuristic might produce a skeptical overreaction. A more straightforward case of the heuristic giving rise to a philosophical paradox is what Tim calls "the persistence heuristic," which is our assumption that things in general don't change, and in particular that small differences don't matter. Per the "ship of Theseus" (the sorties paradox), if you change out one plank of a ship, certainly it's still the same ship, but applying this principle repeatedly could mean you're calling "the same ship" something that has entirely new planks. Yes, it's useful for us to overlook small differences in keeping track of the world, and true in most circumstances that a minute change doesn't matter, but we need to understand that this is merely a heuristic, a rule of thumb, and not a reliable philosophical intuition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A case where a heuristic could potentially come into play is Williamson's topic from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-348-tim-first-110362609"&gt;our ep. 348 &lt;/a &gt;: knowledge as justified true belief (JTB). &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-344-gettier-106697857"&gt;Gettier &lt;/a &gt;had come up with alleged counter-examples where in unusual circumstances a belief could be true and justified, yet still not knowledge. One might argue that some heuristic gone wrong is responsible for these Gettier cases, and we should just ignore them and say that the JTB theory of knowledge is a good one for all ordinary circumstances. Tim does not pursue this strategy in this case: It's hard to see which heuristic would be at fault, and JTB is already according to Tim an inelegant patchwork theory that is guilty of "overfitting," the idea which is central in the second chapter of Tim's book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In science, if one makes a theory more and more complex in light of data countering the original theory, then that theory ceases to have much predictive power. If your wildly jagged graph of expected results matches point-for-point the data you actually achieve, then it's clear you've jiggered this "model" to take all your data at face value, whereas it's actually very likely that some data will be junk: outliers to be dismissed. In ethics, a rule like "you should not lie" might be tweaked and tweaked to include all the intuitively plausible individual cases where a lie seems like it would be morally OK, but a better approach would be to come up with some other way of phrasing the theory, e.g. "you should not lie maliciously" that approaches the simplicity of the original theory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another example of overfitting is Paul Grice's increasingly complicated theory of what "linguistic meaning" amounts to (as discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-325-paul-on-89426489"&gt;our ep. 325 &lt;/a &gt;). Tim is convinced that giving these kinds of analyses is actually not what analytic philosophy should be doing. Either such philosophers are giving psychological theories, in which case it's implausible that the governing psychology could actually be that complicated, or they're trying to describe something metaphysical (about meaning, knowledge, truth, causation, or whatnot). But why assume that these very important metaphysical aspects of our lives are actually analyzable in more basic terms?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about the disquotational heuristic (interpreting someone's words according to our meanings even if the speaker's knowledge makes their meanings different than ours) to talk about &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-34-frege-on-15462540"&gt;Frege's sense-reference distinction &lt;/a &gt;. Another heuristic Tim gets into in his book involve the metaphor of weighing (e.g. reasons), such that intersectionality properly points out that the relation between anti-female discrimination and anti-black discrimination is not simply additive as the heuristic might tell us. Another involves how we interpret conditionals where the antecedent is false: We interpret "If the earth doesn't exist, then water is wet" as more reasonable to believe than "If the earth doesn't exist, then 2+2=5" even though these are both equally (trivially) true given that the earth does exist.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Overfitting-Heuristics-Philosophy-Rutgers-Lectures/dp/0197779212/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CT5KJ59SSZ6P &amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Qq6PAFwBz13gSKMhstKorA.pX8wsjaCy8JtbHgtzcOY0QrNmTFco6feCghBGyTmfDo &amp;amp;dib_tag=se &amp;amp;keywords=overfitting+and+heuristics+in+philosophy &amp;amp;qid=1730562508 &amp;amp;sprefix=overfitting%2Caps%2C137 &amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding our treatment of "Of Seeing" in &lt;em &gt;Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense &lt;/em &gt;. Start with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2024/10/06/ep352-1-reid-epistemology-smelling-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-352-thomas-on-113513216"&gt;ep. 352 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We continue to hammer at this idea of "resemblance." Given that there is some biological/physical encoding process whereby some aspect of an object in the world is sensed, should we say that the signal, and the brain state it brings about, "resembles" that thing. Of course, the thing is a physical object, not a brain state or mental entity, but if in particular a visual field corresponds point-by-point to a structure in the world as seen from a particular angle, wouldn't we want to say that the image, even if warped or transformed into non-imagistic encoding, does more than merely symbolize the original? The association between a word and what it symbolizes (e.g. "dog" and that animal) is entirely arbitrary, but the association between even the smell of a rose and the rose itself, and even moreso that between my visual idea of that rose and the rose, is natural and structurally informative. So is Reid wrong in characterizing our relation to external objects as mediated by sensations that act as "symbols" for these objects?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We consider more carefully Reid's level of support for the primary/secondary quality distinction, how he treats non-signifying feelings like pain and warmth, and finally we look at Reid's comparison of sense experience to testimony. Both cases have a natural component and a learned component. We naturally understand non-verbal communication, and we naturally are brought by a sensation to posit that the object exists. We learn language, and we learn lots of things about objects and how they relate to us, and so we're able to understand the testimony of people and of nature itself. In both cases, there's a necessary baseline assumption of veracity: If people weren't in general telling the truth, we wouldn't even learn language, and lying would literally make no sense. If perception weren't in general veridical, then illusion wouldn't make sense. (We ran into a similar argument when considering the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-346-nyaya-on-108553353"&gt;Nyaya school &lt;/a &gt;.) Developmentally, it's very good for us that we in general believe our senses and other people, as these help our survival. It's only when we're older (and perhaps corrupted by philosophy) that doubts occur.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next time &lt;/strong &gt;: As a sequel to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2024/08/19/ep348-1-williamson-epistemology/" target="_blank"&gt;our past discussion of Tim Williamson &lt;/a &gt;, we're now interviewing him about the first two chapters of his new book, &lt;em &gt;Overfitting and Heuristics in Philosophy &lt;/em &gt;(2024).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-352-thomas-on-113513216"&gt;ep. 352 &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense &lt;/em &gt;(1764), now discussing ch. 6: "Of Seeing."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The moral of Reid's previous treatment of the other senses was that the sensations that a perceived object causes in us do not resemble that thing. The physical rose and its odor have very little in common, and it's only because they are generally present together that think that that particular sort of odor is the odor of that kind of object.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what about sight? In this case, the visual sensation we get of an object actually does resemble it as a picture resembles the object depicted. This is entirely what fooled other philosophers into thinking seeing the general relation between idea and object as one of resemblance (i.e. the image is a degraded copy of the physical original), which Reid argued had several counter-intuitive consequences ultimately leading to Humean skepticism about our ability to know mind-independent objects at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, on closer attention to our visual experience, which Reid invites us to engage in, we see that our visual sensations, e.g. of shape, are still quite different than the shapes out in the world (which we could detect by touch). Only a painter typically has the patience to focus on sensations alone to be able to reproduce these on a canvas, instead of just using the image to take our minds straight to an object (like a signifier takes us to the signified).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get a lot more detail about visual sensations. While there's a structural similarity between the visual sensory image and the object, the visual sphere actually has it own, non-Euclidean geometry to it, as if the images were projected onto the surface of a sphere. When we look down a street, the sides of the street are parallel, and we interpret them as such, yet the actual image we get is of the two converging at some point in the distance. The relation between this warped, two-dimensional image and the three-dimensional world is, as with all the other senses, only one we know from experiencing it, though Reid strangely emphasizes that a blind geometer could predict what this curved space would look like to a sighted person.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We begin Bradley's argument for idealism: The world as we perceive it is appearance, not reality. In ch. 1, "Primary and Secondary Qualities," we see him give Locke's arguments for the distinction and Berkeley's response that both alike are in the mind, not the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We try to make sense of this given our recent reading for The Partially Examined Life of Thomas Reid, who argued for realism against Berkeley and others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Appearance-and-Reality-by-FH-Bradley.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 17.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Bradley was a prominent British Hegelian, best known now for being the springboard for Bertrand Russell, who was initially a follower but then rejected idealism entirely to co-create what is now known as analytic philosophy.

Do we "construct" them out of our various sensations? What does Reid's theory of memory contribute to this?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another point of contrast with past philosophy Reid makes is that we don't first merely "apprehend" an idea, e.g. the smell sensation of a rose and hence the rose, and then decide that a rose exists. The more complex mental operation (positing its existence) comes right at the same time as apprehending it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we talk more about Hume and Reid's correspondence (the book was sent to Hume to review, and Hume didn't seem to get the main point), Reid's story of the history of philosophy, and the skepticism that Reid is arguing against.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;: We're reading more of this book: the chapter on sight (sec. 1-12, 20, and 24).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense &lt;/em &gt;(1764): the introduction, conclusion, ch. 2 "Of Smelling" ch. 4 "Of Hearing," and some correspondence between Reid and Hume. Featuring Mark, Wes, Seth and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Reid was responding to so-called "modern philosophy" from Descartes through Hume and thought that something had gone terribly wrong. From Descartes' idea that the only thing we directly know is our own sensations comes, inevitably according to Reid, Hume's skepticism, not just about the external world (the existence of ordinary objects and their causal relations), but about even minds (ours and other people's). Common sense says that when we have a sensation, our mind is brought immediately to the object that that sensation is supposed to be of. We don't perceive the sensation itself and then infer the object; we gain immediate knowledge of the object. We can actually know causality, material objects, other minds, and our own self as existing over time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Key to accepting this view is the insight (which he attributes to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-89-berkeley-w-30345726"&gt;Berkeley &lt;/a &gt;) that our sensations do not typically resemble material objects. While Berkeley insisted that similarity is the only way that objects could possibly cause sensations, and therefore material objects must not exist at all (it's just ideas in God's mind causing ideas in our minds), Reid says it's just a brute, inexplicable fact that causality between such unlike things occurs. Past philosophers have been deluded about the resemblance between ideas and things by focusing on sight, so instead Reid starts his book by analyzing smell. The noun "smell" is ambiguous, referring both to the sensation (qualia) that we experience in smelling something and also to the object of the act: the odor that is smelled. The latter is some physical property by which little bits of the thing are sent off into our noses, while the former is in the mind, and there's no way we could predict without experience that exactly THIS smell (e.g. of a rose) would match this object (the physical flower).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Instead of thinking of a sensation as a picture of the object it's a sensation of, Reid would prefer we think of it like a language: Yes, we literally directly encounter only our own sensations (so Reid is not a direct realist like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-138-john-on-50859131"&gt;Searle &lt;/a &gt;), but we treat these as symbols for the thing we perceive as indicated by and associated with the sensation. Experiencing the sensation is not a purely receptive state, but involves the judgment that the object exists and is nearby. We could of course be wrong about this, e.g. if it's a rose-scented perfume instead of an actual rose, but we could then explain why we're wrong. This doesn't warrant any kind of general skepticism. If we were not in general right about roses being there when that scent is there, then we would never learn that it's the scent of a rose; many of us have some recognition of common scents used in candles and other items but may have no clear idea of their original source. (I have no ability to pick out a lavender plant.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Reid distinguishes sensations from memory and imagination. While sensation involves a judgment that the object is present, memory involves a judgment that it was present, and imagination doesn't involve any judgment either way about the object's existence. Reid identifies memory in particular as something past philosophers got wrong: They think that when we have a memory, we're contemplating some current idea that is a faded copy of the original sensation. Reid thinks instead that we are thinking &lt;em &gt;of &lt;/em &gt;that original sensation, which is of course long gone. The memory need not resemble the original sensation (after all, memories can be faulty); it is a memory &lt;em &gt;that &lt;/em &gt;something happened which may or may not involve some current imagination about that thing (the scent actually "coming back to you").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Throughout all of this, Reid is arguing against the use of the term of art "ideas" as our sole mental content. For &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-17-humes-what-11380418"&gt;Hume &lt;/a &gt;, there are just impressions and ideas, and ideas are just faded impressions. So the only thing distinguishing memory from perception is that memory is about a more faded kind of idea. Reid thinks that the insistence on reducing mental life to just a few elements is a misguided attempt to apply the model of Newtonian science to philosophy. The mind is irreducibly complex, and there's a lot we don't know about it (even now). Reid suggests that philosophy engage in careful phenomenology to focus on things like the sensation of a smell and its distinction between that and its object (the objective odor) which common practice generally ignores. In this sense, despite the title of his book, Reid is not saying that his philosophy is merely an expression of "common sense." Rather, he claims that any philosophy that blatantly flies in the face of common sense, e.g. in claiming that we can't know the external world or at least can't rationally be certain that we do, is unsustainable for us. We simply can't pretend outside of philosophical armchairs that causality is not actually out in the world, or that the smell of something is only in our heads. When we smell something dreadful, we rightly assume that there's something decaying or otherwise awful out in the world that needs to be cleaned up if we want to get rid of that smell. Unless you're shown that he smelly sensation is experienced by you alone (maybe because you're having a stroke), common sense tells you that it is real, objective, and in the world, even if Locke says it's a mere "secondary quality" that's only in your head. If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around, obviously it makes a sound!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-01702-3.html" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth and Dylan continue talking about philosophy surrounding trans phenomena in light of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/112964064"&gt;our interview with Sophie Grace &lt;/a &gt;about &lt;em &gt;Trans Figured &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start with Sophie's idea that biological sex is itself a cluster concept: several different biological characteristics that make it somewhat arbitrary to say when exactly someone who has undergone hormone treatments and surgery has "transformed" from one natural kind to another (and as we do not mention, she was including some as yet unrealized scientific possibilities whereby one might change chromosomes; see our episode on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-91-plus-more-30346062"&gt;transhumanism &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;From here the discussion quickly moves to trans athletes, touching on the philosophy of sport and why we separate genders in sports in the first place. We then talk about the degree to which gender itself is a matter of natural kinds vs. various interests that are culturally relative (e.g. fashion) and not necessarily tied to some particular gender. What does "demanding respect" mean in the trans context, and how do the ethical issues compare with those involved in feminism and philosophy of race. We also touch on dress codes, pronouns, and bathroom use.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;At the end of the discussion, you can hear me in real time decide that perhaps we should keep this behind our paywall. Thank you for your support and hopefully tolerance for our well-intentioned fumbling on this and many other sensitive issues. We welcome your recommendations of additional things to read and guests to include. I definitely want to continue exploring trans issues on Pretty Much Pop, as there's been a lot of trans representation in pop culture recently, most surprisingly to me the &lt;em &gt;House of the Dragon &lt;/em &gt;appearance of Abigail Thorn from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PhilosophyTube" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy Tube &lt;/a &gt;, who along with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/contrapoints" target="_blank"&gt;Natalie Wynn from Contrapoints &lt;/a &gt;was someone we long tried to contact for our trans episode. We are still open to speaking to either of them if anyone has a connection. This could be a potential topic for any of my podcasts. I had a non-binary Nakedly Examined Music guest scheduled who cancelled on me at the last minute, and some of my guests there have certainly been very candid in the music and our discussions about their LGBTQ+ experiences.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We are also of course open to talking to or reading work by a trans man. One point that didn't get made explicitly in our interview with Sophie is her take that trans men have it relatively easy compared to trans women: The community of men is generally fine with accepting a "tom boy" into their midst (reportedly G.E.M Anscombe was affectionately called "old man" by Wittgenstein and their contemporaries). But according to Sophie, men cannot in general understand why any other man would want to abandon masculinity and so have an immediate reaction of contempt for "girly men" of any sort. It might be interesting to determine to what degree this is the case and why: Is it just that homophobia is more acute among men than women? Sophie's book includes an open letter to J.K. Rowling, who is explicitly more concerned about the supposed rash of girls abandoning femininity based on her own experience of being ambivalent about being female herself when she was young and now thinking that was a misguided sentiment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The image was cribbed from &lt;a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/views/people/38822/sophie-grace-chappell-being-transgender-looked-a-lot-more-favourable-in-2014-than-it-does-now" target="_blank"&gt;this article &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Grace_Chappell" target="_blank"&gt;Sophie Grace &lt;/a &gt;wrote and taught philosophy (chiefly ethics and epistemology) at several different British universities including Oxford and is now a professor at Open University. Mark, Seth, and Dylan interview her about her recently published book &lt;em &gt;Trans Figured &lt;/em &gt;, which mixes autobiography, philosophy, and discussion of current political rhetoric surrounding transgender.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Her strategy is one of acknowledging facts and trying to avoid theories that would confuse or falsify these. As a child, she (among many other boys) experienced gender dysphoria, felt that she had been placed in the wrong body and social status, and now that she's able to present herself as a woman, she feels much more satisfied. Given that this sort of need is real and not something that people can talk themselves out of (she tried for many years to do this), the appropriate moral response is to treat people as they want to be treated. It is a simple matter of justice, respect, and compassion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So Sophie has no "theory of gender," no ambitions a la &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-235-judith-33741772"&gt;Judith Butler &lt;/a &gt;to fundamentally reduce the emphasis on gender in society (though Sophie agrees of course that non-binary persons should also be treated with respect). But there is a role for philosophy here, and Sophie argues for a Wittgensteinian view of concepts that views them not as essential categories with necessary and sufficient conditions, but as having a history and being open to change. Just as one could not validly argue against gay marriage by saying "by definition, marriage is between a man and a woman," one cannot not effectively argue that one's sex is once-and-for-all settled by some particular biological characteristics at birth. Rather, Sophie argues on analogy to adoption that while of course "parenthood" has its origin and paradigm cases in biological parenthood, society should and does have little trouble finding space for adopted parents. We don't rudely point out whenever a child refers to an adopted parent, "but you know, that's not your &lt;em &gt;real &lt;/em &gt;parent." We don't exclude adoptive parents from parent-teacher conferences or from any other social perks and duties involved in parenthood.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, analogically against the rhetorical aggression of tans activists, there is no need to insist that adopted parents in all circumstances must be categorized as parents (e.g. an obvious exception is in giving medical family history). We also need not distort language to insist that all biological parents call themselves "bio-parents" to ensure that adoptive parents don't feel marginalized.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another analogy Sophie gives is becoming a naturalized citizen (she is in fact trans-Scottish). It would be bigoted to insist that only a pureblood, biological Scot is a real Scot. What makes Sophie Scottish when she was born in England is that she's gone through a diligent process to align her outlook and interests with being a citizen of that community, and she should be (and is) welcomed into it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss essentialism, pragmatism, conceptual engineering (e.g. the invention of the term "sexual harassment"), moral progress, bodily phenomenology, biological sex as a cluster concept, inclusionary feminism, and hermeneutic justice.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In addition to reading &lt;a href="https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=trans-figured-on-being-a-transgender-person-in-a-cisgender-world--9781509561506" target="_blank"&gt;Trans Figured &lt;/a &gt;, we all looked at an article called "&lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/91942381/Trans_without_the_gender" target="_blank"&gt;Trans Without the Gender &lt;/a &gt;" (2022), which is a response to &lt;a href="https://www.rachcoskerrowland.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Rach Cosker-Rowland &lt;/a &gt;. Mark brings up Sophie's 2009 article "&lt;a href="https://oro.open.ac.uk/24579/1/ethics_beyond_moral_theory.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Ethics Beyond Moral Theory &lt;/a &gt;," and she describes &lt;em &gt;Trans Figured &lt;/em &gt;as essentially an application of her last book &lt;a href="https://oro.open.ac.uk/96692/" target="_blank"&gt;Epiphanes &lt;/a &gt;. She's currently promoting a new book on friendship that is the third in this trilogy. See &lt;a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/people/tc2973#tab3" target="_blank"&gt;her Open University page &lt;/a &gt;for many of her publications.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Sophie also refers to Jan Morris' &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/117486/conundrum-by-jan-morris/" target="_blank"&gt;Conundrum &lt;/a &gt;(1973), Rebecca Jane Morgan's &lt;a href="https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745349015/gender-heretics/" target="_blank"&gt;Gender Heretics &lt;/a &gt;(2023), Danièle Moyal-Sharrock's &lt;a href="https://www.politybooks.com/blog-detail/real-gender-a-cis-defence-of-trans-realities" target="_blank"&gt;Real Gender &lt;/a &gt;(2024).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In part two (exclusively for you supporters), the PEL guys will continue to hash through these issues.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding on “Universality and Truth” from Richard Rorty’s &lt;em &gt;Pragmatism As Anti-Authoritarianism &lt;/em &gt;. Start with the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/112017169"&gt;previous part &lt;/a &gt;, or better yet, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-349-rortys-111232983"&gt;ep. 349 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite Rorty’s rejection of transcendent Truth, he claims not to be a relativist. An absolutist accusing someone of being a relativist is saying “either our beliefs are caused by things in the world or we are constructing beliefs regardless of the true state of the world, and you are doing the latter.” Rorty rejects this alternative: there is no distinction that makes any difference between these two views, if on either of them one can pursue science, look for evidence, and demonstrate or argue for some point. Rather Rorty has no theory of truth. Is this a coherent position? Do we need such a theory, or is such theorizing just another language game?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Time &lt;/strong &gt;: We’re discussing the new book &lt;em &gt;Trans Figured &lt;/em &gt;with its author, Prof. &lt;a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/people/tc2973" target="_blank"&gt;Sophie Grace Chappell &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On “Universality and Truth” and “Pan-Relationalism,” which are lectures 3-5 in Richard Rorty’s &lt;em &gt;Pragmatism As Anti-Authoritarianism &lt;/em &gt;, which we began discussing &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-349-rortys-111232983"&gt;last episode &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan continue to hash through Rorty’s pragmatism, which in this book is given in relation to how to best promote democracy. Rorty thinks democracy can “stand on its own two feet”; it has obvious advantages that we can refer to without bringing in an objective standard of morality that it is in accord with or anything else like that. All there is in political deliberation is human argumentation, and we humans are the only judges of what arguments are effective. We do not do this by reference to an objective standard; we are aiming for agreement, not transcendent Truth. If people raised outside of a liberal society don’t see the benefits of democracy (don’t judge that the effects we point to are benefits), then their opinions may only change given some change in their emotions (e.g. make &lt;em &gt;Nazis read The Diary of Anne Frank &lt;/em &gt;). Part of this is an argument against &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-252-habermas-41592656"&gt;Habermas &lt;/a &gt;, who argues that communication itself implies an ethic of openness that is pro-democratic. You could therefore in a rather Kantian style argue that someone against democracy is being inconsistent, i.e. irrational.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The term pan-relationalism describes Rorty’s ontology: There is no distinction between a substance and its properties. Any way of referring to a substance is just pulling out more properties. A property may be more important to you for some particular purpose, but no property in itself is more “essential” than any other (contra essentialists like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-337-aristotle-100113781"&gt;Aristotle &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-339-brian-on-101920316"&gt;Ellis &lt;/a &gt;). One implication of this view is that our relation to the world is irreducibly propositional (the term from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-154-wilfrid-50992909"&gt;Sellars &lt;/a &gt;is “psychological nominalism”); there is nothing we’d call knowledge that is merely pre-linguistic, since that would (according to Rorty) present an picture where we’re directly in touch with essences.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://ollehalvars.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Olle Halvars &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We begin a long series on Maurice Merleau-Ponty's "Phenomenology of Perception" (1945), focusing on Part I, "The Body": "Experience and Objective Thought."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;M-P talks first about what seeing an object (like a house) in the world involves. It pre-supposes a relation to us as perceivers, which involves our situatedness in a body. Yet when we make our own body into an objective object in space and time (like the house), we've shifted it from this primordial center of perception into something described like perception. What is involved in this shift?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://voidnetwork.gr/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Phenomenology-of-Perception-by-Maurice-Merleau-Ponty.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 77 (PDF p. 102).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/108921274"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/111232983"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on Richard Rorty’s &lt;em &gt;Pragmatism As Anti-Authoritarianism &lt;/em &gt;, ch. 1, “Pragmatism and Religion” and 2, “Pragmatism as Romantic Polytheism.”&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Rorty evaluates James, Dewey, and Peirce on religion and finds Dewey’s approach most fruitful toward promoting democracy. While James promoted tolerance, Dewey thought that we should regulate our actions and beliefs by the need to join with other people in cooperative projects. Whereas our recent reading of James pointed to the need to recognize and grapple with suffering, so religion is needed to essentially relieve us from what Rorty calls “original sin,” Dewey is more straightforwardly optimistic, focused on hope. Rorty, contra James, claims that to be rational is to submit all of one’s beliefs to the judgment of one’s peers; religion cannot be “privatized” the way James would like. At the same time, Rorty acknowledges that private beliefs can be used to make your own personality coherent, which is part of the thriving diversity that democracy shoots for.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Rorty also gives us a Freudian take on the evolution of religion, saying that when God the Father (or the literal tyrannical father of an ancient tribe) is slain, ideally we want a fraternity of dependents to take over, i.e. democracy instead of a new-boss-same-as-the-old-boss situation. So replacing religious ethics with Kantian ethics is still a lateral move, according to Rorty; we want to be communal creators of values.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He also has some comments about Nietzsche, who was all about that “creators of values” philosophy but who looked down on democracy. Nietzsche (according to Rorty) thought that once you think of people as just “clever animals,” you have no reason to wish for the good of all human beings. Rorty obviously disagrees. In &lt;strong &gt;our next episode &lt;/strong &gt;, we’ll take on such political (and epistemic) issues more directly, reading lectures 3-5 (i.e. the next two chapters): “Universality and Truth” and “Pan-Relationalism.”&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Richard Rorty's &lt;em &gt;Pragmatism As Anti-Authoritarianism &lt;/em &gt;(written 1997), ch. 1-2. Should democracy be defended on absolutist grounds, e.g. by reference to God-given or natural rights, the nature of Man, or the dictates of Reason?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Throughout this book (adapted from a series of 1997 lectures but not published until 2021 after Rorty's death), Rorty argues that democracy, ethics, and even truth itself are a matter for societies to decide for themselves. There is no truly non-human authority that we can refer to in defending a way of life or even a scientific theory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Of course, these two types of claim (normative for ethics vs. descriptive for science) sure look like they'd have different grounds for defense. To prove a matter of fact, I might point you to a relevant perception or calculation and invite you to confirm this. To prove a moral claim, I might point to some sentiment or moral precept that I know you have (and that presumably we share). What these have in common is that they're referring to some shared practice, and they presuppose some particular audience for justification. If your moral intuitions have nothing in common with mine, I won't be able to convince you that some action is wrong, and if you claim to perceive or reason differently than me, then you won' t find my scientific arguments convincing. For a pragmatist, it's simply unnecessary and in fact counter-productive to think about justification as comparison of a belief with "the truth." We have no access to truth beyond the particular methods of verification and justification which we engage in, and so maybe we should just talk about those methods.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does this mean that Rorty and other pragmatists are relativists? Rorty follows &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-191-schemes-19104205"&gt;Donald Davidson &lt;/a &gt;in denying that there's any sense to be made in two people having fundamentally different conceptual schemes such that they can't reason together. But he doesn't attribute this to our all having some "human nature" objectively in common such that Reason as something objectively binding on all of us compels us to agree. Specifically with regard to democracy, Rorty doesn't think that a commitment to egalitarian consideration of everyone's opinions and interests (everyone gets a vote) is somehow implied in the way we speak and reason with each other. He just thinks it's a good idea, which means that it produces the kind of society that we at this point in history and in this part of the world think is desirable. If we want to convince someone in a repressive, elitist society that democracy is good, we could try to show that the people who are marginalized in his society are just as worthy, just as human, just as easy to sympathize with, as the people his society currently respects. Do we know in advance that everyone will (or should?) be convinced by these argumentative moves? Is it necessary that our arguments be designed to convince &lt;em &gt;all possible audiences &lt;/em &gt;? Rorty says no.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We'll further consider the epistemological and political aspects of this book in ep. 350, covering the next three lectures. In this part in discussion, we're focusing on Rorty's claim that appeals to Truth are quasi-religious in the sense that, like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-46-plato-on-15467712"&gt;the Divine Command Theory of morality &lt;/a &gt;, they appeal to some non-human authority. This is the kind of move that authoritarians make: THIS is the law because we the rulers know God's will. Rorty considers alternative, pragmatist approaches to religion, such as William James' in "&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-22-more-is-is-11380696"&gt;The Will to Believe &lt;/a &gt;," where James "privatizes" religion, removing it from a position where it can do damage to our cooperative projects, and in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-345-william-107624683"&gt;The Varieties of Religious Experience &lt;/a &gt;, where he (wrongly, according to Rorty) argues that religious tenets in their broad outlines can be objectively established as true.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Even the "privatization" of religion to the sphere of belief is not great, according to Rorty, as our beliefs as expressing positions in public language games (e.g. observation, evidence) tend to impinge on those among our projects that are relevant other people (most of them are, after all). You can't just "believe" that the world is flat without this affecting your behavior in ways that will undermine social efforts. You can't just believe that you are a member of a chosen people that will be rewarded after death, with all unbelievers punished, without this affecting how you treat others, the respect you have (or don't have) for them. All of these gods compete, for Rorty, with democracy as something for us all to strive for as a group. While democracy should encourage and protect diversity of opinion, any opinion is subject to discussion and debate with others; that's part of the language game as laid out in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-183-mill-on-16804983"&gt;Mill's "On Liberty."&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The two lectures/chapters we read for this discussion include "Pragmatism and Religion" and "Pragmatism as Romantic Polytheism." Re. the second of these essays, Rorty says that traditional deference to The Truth and The Good is a form of monotheism. Rorty prefers the idea that there is more than one ideal, dependent on what purposes we adopt. We've seen this idea ethically in Nietzsche, who instead of urging us to attain to some single ideal of behavior (e.g. "What would Jesus do?" Or Confucius, or Socrates...) instead encourages us to "become you we are," where each of us has some different path, and we have some freedom to choose and even create that path. What counts as a relevant truth when we're looking at non-moral "facts" is dependent on why we want to know. Is this physical object mostly solid? If you want to pick it up, yes it is. If you want to analyze its microstructure, one relevant truth is that it's mostly empty space, and so not "solid."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674248915" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://sites.pitt.edu/~rbrandom/Courses/Antirepresentationalism%20%282020%29/Texts/Rorty%20Pragmatism%20as%20Anti-Authoritarianism%201999.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the first chapter online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The image is by &lt;a href="https://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/110362609"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, we finish up "Knowledge First Epistemology" (2011), and delve further into "Justifications, Excuses, and Sceptical Scenarios" (2015), and "Morally Loaded Cases in Philosophy" (2019).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does Williamson's approach compare to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-344-gettier-106725178"&gt;Goldman's reliabilism &lt;/a &gt;? (Note that &lt;a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/08/11/alvin-goldman-1938-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;Goldman just passed away &lt;/a &gt;.) Williamson distinguishes between actually following a norm and being the kind of person who generally follows norms. Morally, we can distinguish between someone who is generally morally praiseworthy and someone who actually does the right thing. One can intend to do the right thing, but because of a lack of knowledge, in fact do the wrong thing. Pointed at the case of knowledge, having knowledge is like actually obeying the norm, and merely having a reliable knowledge procedure (how Goldman defines justification) is comparable to being in general virtuous.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Consequently, while Goldman allows the possibility of justified belief that is yet untrue and so not knowledge, Williamson this out. No matter what your intention or your how good your knowledge-gathering habits maybe, you still have not successfully justified a belief unless that belief ends up being true. What the false-but-seemingly-justified believer has is an good excuse, just as the virtuous person who acts on bad knowledge and so ends up doing evil has an excuse. It doesn't make the bad act actually good (as Kant might insist, being wholly fixated on the moral value of motives), or in this case does it not make a brain-in-vat who seriously investigates his (illusory) surroundings actually justified in the many incorrect beliefs it has about its environment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Williamson does have things to say actually about ethics here too. Is is possible to be, morally, in a situation analogous to the brain in a vat? The brain in a vat simply has no way of seeing through its illusions, no resources to draw on. Could a self-consistent Nazi with Nazi sensibilities be cut off from any moral reactions that would provide reason to question his moral assumptions? We would not blame the brain for being ignorant, but we probably feel like we can blame the Nazi.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We finish up by talking about whether Williamson has a good argument against relativism or skepticism (or needs one).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next time: We're reading the first two lectures in Richard Rorty's &lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674248915" target="_blank"&gt;Pragmatism and Anti-Authoritarianism &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Mark and Wes are joined by guests &lt;a href="https://www.humanities.uci.edu/russell-ming" target="_blank"&gt;Russell Ming &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/?s=%22chris+heath%22" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Heath &lt;/a &gt;to cover &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Williamson" target="_blank"&gt;this important current figure &lt;/a &gt;in analytic epistemology.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This position is another breed of externalism (like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-347-nyaya-one-109480317"&gt;Nyaya &lt;/a &gt;), which means saying knowledge is a matter of an actual connection to the world, as opposed to an internalist picture whereby an individual knower is in a position to know that knowledge is taking place. A piece of internalist advice might be "you should only believe what you have evidence for." But this assumes that we know whether any given observation or belief counts as evidence. Williamson, however, wants to define even evidence externally. Misleading or false evidence actually doesn't count as evidence at all, but pseudo-evidence. More generally, we should understand false belief by first understanding knowledge, which involves true belief.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is belief itself "external" in the way that on this view evidence and knowledge are? Yes, if our belief involves words, which involve meanings that are essentially public, and not always clear to the speaker (see Wittgenstein on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-56-more-on-17044181"&gt;private languages &lt;/a &gt;). Williamson sums this up by saying that virtually no mental concept is actually "luminous": fully understood by the thinker, i.e. internal. For example, if I believe that the snow over there is white, but actually it's not snow but a group of white moths, then on Williamson's example, my belief is not about the thing I thought it was about; it's about moths instead of snow. It's certainly not about a snow-appearing sensory experience that may or may not be actually connected with snow.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A result of all this is that while you might have thought that the "mental" in general is characterized by luminous (I prefer "transparent") content -- the contents of consciousness -- while something like knowledge that also involves the external criterion of truth would only be partially mental and partly metaphysical, it turns out that much of our mental life is not known to us. A prime characteristic of the mental is intentionality in the sense of aboutness: This belief or perception or hope or whatnot is about some external thing or state of affairs or possible state of affairs. Since the intentional content will in most cases be something public, whether a proposition or a state of affairs in the world, then we should expect all intentional mentality to have an external component. This doesn't mean that it isn't truly "mental."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also touch on Williamson's 2022 essay "&lt;a href="https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/files/kail20paperpdf-0" target="_blank"&gt;Where Did It Come From?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;More about "enframing" and how this relates to "revealing." There's a good kind of making/revealing (arts and crafts, i.e. poiesis), but the enframing that challenges us ("destines" us) to reveal things as mere standing reserve is BAD. But even this latter involves some freedom: an opportunity to learn something important about ourselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/4/44/Heidegger_Martin_The_Question_Concerning_Technology_and_Other_Essays.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with &lt;/a &gt;us starting on p. 31.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Dylan reconvened a couple days after &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-347-nyaya-two-109480324"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;to finish discussing personal identity (ch. 4) in &lt;em &gt;Nyaya Sutra: Selections with Early Commentaries &lt;/em &gt;. Whereas in the previous discussion, we were largely focusing on the metaphysical and logical arguments for the existence of an enduring self, here we go into a bit more depth about the moral arguments: There needs to be a self to make sense of our practices of praise and blame.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The religious background of this discussion involved reincarnation, which interestingly gets a new-to-us argument that has a parallel to Plato's arguments about recollection. How is instinct possible? Our authors here claim that for us to know how to smile, for instance, must be based on our having learned it, and since babies seem to do this spontaneously (not having learned it from their parents), then they must have learned it before birth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In addition to responding to Buddhists, the Nyayas are also responding to materialists who don't believe in the soul at all. Admitting that consciousness has to root in something, because it's a characteristic that needs a substance, could consciousness be the quality of the material body? The Nyaya argument response is that the body is still a body when it's dead. If the existence of body were all that were required for consciousness, then all bodies, even dead bodies, would have consciousness. Listen to hear why we think this Nyaya argument is obviously lame!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, and Dylan now turn to ch. 4 of Dasti/Phillips' &lt;em &gt;Nyaya Sutra: Selections with Early Commentaries &lt;/em &gt;about the self. Buddhism famously claims that there is no self.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Metaphysically, we can take the pro-self position (atman) as involving something like a soul that exists over time. As we'll get into further in part three of this discussion, this is morally problematic in the Indian tradition, since they (Buddhists included) believe in karma and re-incarnation. If there is no self, what is it that endures through rebirths, and even in this life, what sense would there be in punishing someone (whether through divine or human justice) if there is no persistent entity to hold the blame (or praise) for actions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this part of the discussion, we focus on the more experiential and inferential arguments. It certainly seems that there must be something that makes my various experiences belong to me and yours belonging to you. If consciousness were just a single, universal subject (whether &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purusha" target="_blank"&gt;purusha &lt;/a &gt;or God) that happens to be peering out of various eyes, i.e. we really all are One, then it'd be a significant task to explain why we certainly appear to be many different, persistent people. (This Oneness doctrine is actually Vedantin, not Buddhist.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buddhism has a term for this, however, which is "conventional reality," which they contrast with ultimate reality. This should sound familiar from Hume: we do perceive a succession of experience, and my succession no doubt differs from yours, but we are not justified in positing some underlying substance that makes that succession hang together. It's merely useful for us to talk as if there are such substances, not the least because we have separate bodies, our memories differ, and we do want to keep track of people based on their separate characters and actions so we can form relationships, make promises, know who to watch out for, etc. While Hume stops with the skeptical point that we don't know what, if anything, underlies on this, and so we can't be using a primordial sense of this underlying self to identify ourselves and distinguish ourselves from others, a Buddhist alternative involves the positive assertion that we can know the reality behind these appearances: that it is all Void or One (these would amount to the same thing; a "thing" requires differentiation from other things, so everything being a singular All and everything being Nothing are the same claim).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Nyaya position argues, for instance, that since we have desire (and other psychological characteristics), and throughout our experience, all characteristics (properties) have a bearer, something that HAS the property, then something must have these psychological characteristics. This is not just some convenient fiction, but an evident reality, per the Nyaya methodology of relying on knowledge sources unless you have a good reason to deny their verdict. We seem to both directly perceive a self (the mind) through apperception, or if you deny this, you still have to admit this inference to the best explanation given all these otherwise free-floating psychological characteristics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Complicating this is the idea that reality might not be ultimately made up of things, but of processes. Maybe "the mind"/"the self" is just something that our body (our brain) does: an activity that's happening as our embodied brains walk around perceiving, thinking, and acting. This might be a way to think about the self not being a persistent substance, but just some representation that develops through brain activity, not through mere "convention," but essentially given the kinds of creatures we are. Per &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-171-buddhism-52103251"&gt;our Robert Wright interview &lt;/a &gt;, some scientists see the brain as modular in such a way that there's no single control center that corresponds to our pre-scientific notion of a self. Maybe the self is a self-representation that occurs via a complex network of processes, and so not a persistent thing at all, much less a soul that would persist beyond death. Per &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-261-derek-on-46364380"&gt;our Parfit episode &lt;/a &gt;, maybe our everyday concept of personal identity is simply incoherent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading three articles by Timothy Williamson, whose groundbreaking book Knowledge and Its Limits came out in 2000. These articles expound on the views developed there: "&lt;a href="https://fphil.uniba.sk/fileadmin/fif/katedry_pracoviska/kfdf/Personal/Nuhlicek/Literatura/Teorie_zdovodnenia/Williamson__T._-_Knowledge_First_Epistemology__2011_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Knowledge First Epistemology &lt;/a &gt;" (2011), "&lt;a href="https://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/assets/pdf_file/0018/35343/Luxembourg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Justifications, Excuses, and Sceptical Scenarios &lt;/a &gt;" (2015), and "&lt;a href="https://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/docs/people/williamson/SandersPAAPA.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Morally Loaded Cases in Philosophy &lt;/a &gt;" (2019).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're continuing to explore Nyaya epistemology, in this part focusing on ch. 3, "In Defense of the Real," in &lt;em &gt;Nyaya Sutra: Selections with Early Commentaries &lt;/em &gt;(2017). Featuring Mark, Wes, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-346-nyaya-on-108553353"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;, we laid out the "knowledge sources" (perception, inference, testimony) and established that each of these is defined as successful contact with the world. If you perceive a mirage as water (or a person as a post, the example in the text), then you are not perceiving what you think you see. This "externalist" view is at variance with the Cartesian, "internalist" tradition according to which what we perceive is some mental content which may or may not hook up with the real world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our authors are engaging with Buddhists in ancient India who argue either that there literally is nothing, that all we perceive is illusion (see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-27-nagarjuna-11380788"&gt;our Nagarjuna episode &lt;/a &gt;), that it's all in our mind, or that we simply aren't equipped to know the reality of the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Nyayas respond that even to entertain the idea that we might be deluded (e.g. that we're right now in a dream), we have to refer to the known real world by contrast with illusion. On top of that, in actual dreams, all the elements come from our waking life; we must be acquainted with reality in order to have these ideas. When we do suffer an illusion, we can explain the origin of this, e.g. we can talk about the physics of mirages. A way of characterizing all of these is that illusion is parasitic on reality, so claiming that &lt;em &gt;all &lt;/em &gt;of reality is unreal is simply incoherent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In part two (actually a different conversation on a different day), Mark, Seth, and Dylan deal specifically with Buddhist skepticism regarding the self. Nyayas argue that the self is evidently real and offer several arguments to that effect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A nice, concise presentation of the central arguments here is given in a 2012 article by one of our book's editors, Matthew Dasti, "&lt;a href="https://vc.bridgew.edu/philosophy_fac/1/" target="_blank"&gt;Parasitism and Disjunctivism in Nyaya Epistemology &lt;/a &gt;."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is technology, REALLY? People think of it as neutral, as something that can be used for good or misused, but what is it really to be a TOOL in such a way? Heidegger analyzes causality itself, arguing that our modern emphasis on the mechanical (efficient) cause of something is impoverished as compared to Aristotle's.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/4/44/Heidegger_Martin_The_Question_Concerning_Technology_and_Other_Essays.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with &lt;/a &gt;us starting on PDF p. 38:  (p. 4 in the text).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/108921274"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/108553353"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on ch. 1, “Knowledge Sources,” of the Matthew Dasti/Stephen Phillips presentation of the &lt;em &gt;Nyaya-Sutra: Selections with Early Commentaries &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We continue discussing modalities of perception (why no love for a smell-based philosophy?) and further consider the Sutra’s dictum that perception must be inerrant and how this dovetails with the overall Nyaya approach: Consider a claim that someone makes based upon a knowledge source “established” unless someone then has a legitimate reason to challenge it, i.e. can also refer to a knowledge source to claim the contrary. So perception is a legitimate knowledge source, but I can legitimately ask you when you claim to have seen something if you really got a good look at it. What I can’t do is act the skeptic and ask you to doubt all your perceptions. There is no reason to do this; I have no standing — no practical worry — to demand this more global re-examination.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then move on to inference, which is exemplified in these texts as a matter of induction: I have seen smoke and fire consistently together in the past, so when I see smoke (the inferential mark) now, I conclude there must be fire. However, another example given is the inference that there is a self based on the presence of desire and other mental activities. Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am” is certainly not induction, i.e. not based on past experiences of seeing my thoughts and my self always together, as any past experience would require the same proof of a self. We’ll get into this argument about self more in the second part of our ep. 347, but the point here is just that inference must refer to any kind of reasoning: an inference to the best explanation for something we perceive. Desire seems to be a property, and we know from past experiences that properties have substances, so a desire must inhere in something, and we call that something a self.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But is there a clean line between perception and inference? When I perceive an apple and recognize it as an apple, I am inferring that this thing I now see must be an apple because it looks like previous objects that I and others coupled with the word “apple.” Or if we stick to the requirement that perception is not in itself verbal, does any use of memory necessarily involve an inference?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This may be why the text actually gives “comparison” as a separate knowledge source. For instance, if someone has told me about a bison being “like a cow but bigger, furrier, and brown,” then when I see a bison for the first time, I might use this comparison to attach the word to the animal. This is surely a form of inference, and it’s a specific enough kind of case that it’s unclear that it helps us decide whether recognizing a particular fruit that we’ve seen a lot but which no one’s ever told us the name of counts as mere perception or perception plus some kind of inference.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we briefly consider testimony, which was especially important and independent of the others because the authors wanted to leave room for the inerrancy of the holy Vedic scriptures. So testimony is not reducible to perception, at least not of the ordinary kind; the scriptural authors had supernatural powers of perception and are reporting those perceptions to us. In ordinary cases, we are relying on the perception or valid reasoning of someone who knows what they’re talking about in the relevant sense, whether because they have first-hand perceptual knowledge of the thing or have the expertise to make valid inferences in that domain (as when we listen to scientists or other experts). Is the decision to accept someone’s testimony itself an inference, such that we should really consider testimony a flavor of inference? If I have often see a certain politician lie, it’s reasonable for me to infer that the thing he’s saying now is also a lie. However, as with all the knowledge sources, a lie wouldn’t actually be considered testimony at all, just pseudo-testimony. These analyses are about classifying the sources of legitimate knowledge, when this is present, and do not actually help us as knowers to distinguish the real thing from an imitation in particular cases. To gain these skills, we’d have to use our perceptions over time and the advice (testimony) of experienced teachers. We’d assume (reasonably, on the Nyaya view) that the information from these sources is usually reliable. Truth is the default, and doubt is introduced only when there’s some reason to challenge an assertion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Time: &lt;/strong &gt;We’re reading more of this book, covering chapters 3 (“In Defense of the Real”) and 4 (“Self”).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the &lt;em &gt;Nyaya Sutra: Selections with Early Commentaries &lt;/em &gt;. While the original Sutra, reputed to be by someone named Akṣapāda (which means "looking at his feet") Gautama was written somewhere around 150 CE, this 2017 edition by Matthew Dasti and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-270-classical-51713547"&gt;our previous guest Stephen Phillips &lt;/a &gt;features many more words by the commentators Vatsyayana (450 CE), Uddyotakara (550), and Vācaspatimiśra (900), and by the editors themselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this discussion, we look into Ch. 1 "Knowledge Sources," which are chiefly perception, inference, and testimony. Perception gets by far the most lengthy treatment, differentiating between perceptions of different ontological categories of things like a pot vs. the individual brown swatch of color that inheres in the pot vs. the universal property brown. These differences matter because the Nyaya Sutra is giving us an externalist account of perception, where the point is not that a perceiver has a sensation that may or may not actually be connected to the world, but that in a legitimate case of perception, the sense organ comes into direct contact with the item perceived. So this raises physical and metaphysical questions about how our senses connect with objects at a distance, and we get to hear, for instance, about how ancient Indians thought of sound as the vibration of the ether, which is one, massive, undifferentiated substance (so not like air or water which are made up of particles) such that by making the noise I move the either that moves your eardrum not unlike if I were poking it with a long stick.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Perception also occurs, according to the sutra, without language, which is a weird thing to say if we want to include the possibility of perceiving the metaphysically universal brown, which seems tied to the verbal concept brown. Uddyotakara explains this by saying that a perception typically has three moments to it: I non-verbally perceive a thing, then I recall memories similar to that thing, then these memories overlay my perception such that I identify it as a perception of that type of thing. So some perceptions might stop at the first moment, or someone (certainly a pre-verbal child or sophisticated animal, but really, anyone) could potentially go through all three steps without having a specific name for the thing in question. An interesting twist is that one of the types of perception listed is perception of an absence: I expect to see something, don't see it, and so conclude that it isn't there. But yet we're supposed to interpret this as similarly non-verbal and immediate.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Unlike for Western thinkers like Locke, on the Nyaya account, color and sound are not "secondary qualities" that are essentially subjective. To successfully perceive a color is just like perceiving a shape or anything else: If you perceive a color differently than I do, one of us is just wrong, and we could look at what environmental or physiological factors led to one (or both) of us failing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nyaya-sutra-Selections-Early-Commentaries/dp/1624666167" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Completing lecture 15 of "The Varieties of Religious Experience." Are saints a boon to society, or do they actually make the rest of us less ethical by setting an impossible exemplar? We bring up &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-164-idiot-on-51483477"&gt;Dostoevsky's The Idiot &lt;/a &gt;and Nietzsche, who according to James had only contempt for saints (&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-262-nietzsche-46964471"&gt;but we know better &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does the saint represent the feminine/maternal, while Nietzsche's warlike man is the masculine/paternal (such that we need both for a balanced society), or is the saint in contrast the Apollonian (the organized/lawlike/"name of the father") while the ubermensch is the Dionysian (the more primal, chaotic, feminine Other)? Does it matter?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://dn790004.ca.archive.org/0/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.46316/2015.46316.Varieties-Of-Religious-Experience.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 361.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "The Varieties of Religious Experience," the conclusion of lecture 15. Why do some saintly types engage in ascetic practices like voluntary poverty?

Self-denial is a less destructive way of expressing a martial character than actually going to war.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://dn790004.ca.archive.org/0/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.46316/2015.46316.Varieties-Of-Religious-Experience.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 352 (PDF p. 369).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For more of this book, see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-345-william-107624683"&gt;ep. 345 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/108084591"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;and will get additional coverage to this reading as it's released, along with all the other Closereads content.

Does James' claim that science and culture shouldn't ignore the subjective point of view really mean that the religious objects that motivate people are &lt;em &gt;real &lt;/em &gt;, and that each of us should be open to religious sentiments in others a nd require them of ourselves? James describes the sole focus on objectivity as comparable to just studying a menu when we really want to act actual food with our own mouths (our subjective life).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When people are subjectively reacting to an "unseen realm," are they in fact reacting to one and the same metaphysical facts (e.g. the actual existence of a God who can have various relations with us)? Or is the thing that we share a psychological fact about the unconscious? Does it make sense to consider that the unconscious of each of us may be connected to some shared metaphysical feature of the world (as in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-81-jung-on-w-27510128"&gt;Jung's collective unconscious &lt;/a &gt;), and is James committed to something like this? The view even seems to provide potential legitimacy to synchronicities like the effectiveness of rain dances (as discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-173-relating-52103905"&gt;our American Indian philosophy episode &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next Time: We're reading &lt;a href="https://hackettpublishing.com/religion/asian-thought/the-nyaya-sutra" target="_blank"&gt;The Nyaya-Sutra: Selections with Early Commentaries &lt;/a &gt;, translated and edited by Matthew Dasti and Stephen Phillips in 2017, chapter one on "knowledge sources."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Check out Mark's Big Books in Continental Philosophy fall class at &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/class." target="_blank"&gt;partiallyexaminedlife.com/class.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Varieties of Religious Experience &lt;/em &gt;(1902), focusing on lectures 1-3 and 20. What is religion and how should philosophers study it?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;James describes a religion as a full-life reaction to the world and distinguishes it from philosophy by saying it must be serious (so Voltaire's "Who cares?" philosophy or anything too steeped in irony doesn't qualify) and must enthusiastically accept the universe (no Schopenhauerian pessimism or even the grudging acceptance he attributes to Marcus Aurelius). It must involve some kind of personal, emotional involvement and not just a set of beliefs, rituals, and practices. According to this view, many just practice religious second-hand as part of their social lives, but insofar as we &lt;em &gt;feel &lt;/em &gt;the divine (whatever that means to us; it needn't involve a deity), we are getting at the experiences that gave rise to religion in the first place. James' task in this lecture series is to examine those "religious geniuses" who had such experiences to an extreme degree, and his scope includes mystical experiences, sainthood, conversion, the (minor) place of religious philosophy, and other topics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;James is of course known as a psychologist (see our eps. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-179-william-15944072"&gt;179 &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-180-more-self-16164009"&gt;180 &lt;/a &gt;), and he's writing at the tail end of when &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/introspection/" target="_blank"&gt;introspective psychology &lt;/a &gt;was considered scientifically respectable (he had some issues with such psychologists himself despite his arguably being one of them). Most of this book is just lengthy quotes from writings or speeches by people reporting on their religious feelings and experiences, and James concludes that "the unseen" can be a real force in human psychology. Is he committed to the literal existence of unseen forces (God or ghosts or whatever), or just how ideas about these affect behavior and beliefs? Probably the former, but James' pragmatism makes this difficult to determine, since according to strict pragmatism, the existence of something just &lt;em &gt;is &lt;/em &gt;its effects on people.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;James is more definite in saying that mystical experiences, while often perceived as conveying definite information to the individual having them, contain "no specific intellectual content whatever." They do not provide evidence of religious claims that can be legitimately conveyed to others, and in fact they tend to just reinforce what someone already believes: A Christian will most likely interpret their experience as involving Jesus, while a Buddhist will report experience of the Void or the Buddha, etc. James describes specific theologies as "overbeliefs," not actually justified by these experiences. Moreover, James acknowledges that these theological and philosophical aspects are not in themselves sufficient to motivate acceptance of religion. This is not to say that religion isn't aided by words or images (certainly for religions to spread), but the religious attitude is at bottom emotional. It could be (for what he called the "once-born") an optimistic determination to ignore evil and interpret the world as a gift, or it could be (for the "twice-born") a proper recognition of the tragedy and evil in life (we're all going to die, after all) but yet a use of religion as an emotional recompense: For example, there is sin, but Christ died for my sins, and feeling his glory and forgiveness can make it on sum a positive experience, or there is earthly suffering, but I can feel my Buddha-nature and see beyond and thus transcend suffering. In talking about ascetics, James says that the religious could even purposely make the suffering worse through sacrifice or self-torture because doing so makes the recompense all the grander. These shifts between optimism and pessimism back to optimism certainly have to involve words and doctrines, but theodicy-type &lt;em &gt;arguments &lt;/em &gt;that we should all look on the bright side will be just as powerless to convince as arguments about God's existence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This emphasis on the emotional and subjective is not a dismissal of religion as merely irrational. James is very much a proponent of religion, and argues against scientistic views that would rule out the utility or even necessity of religious feelings and beliefs. James argues that religious enthusiasm ("sthetic feeling") is the unique antidote for nihilism in the face of our mortality and suffering.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Listen also to our early episodes &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-20-pragmatism-11380562"&gt;on James' pragmatism &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-22-more-is-is-11380696"&gt;on his essay from a few years earlier than the current text, "The Will to Believe."&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/86614/the-varieties-of-religious-experience-by-william-james/" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.46316" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "What Is Justified Belief?" (1979) by Alvin Goldman, where he tries to come up with a "function" for justification: If a belief has such-and-such non-epistemic properties, then it counts as justified. This discussion continues from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/106697857"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, where we discussed the Gettier problems that (in part) motivate Goldman's account.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes a property "epistemic" in this sense is not just that it has something to do with knowledge. "True" counts as a metaphysical property, while "feels certain of" is a psychological property. The epistemic ones are all normative, as in good or bad as these words apply to knowledge. So Goldman doesn't want us just to say that a belief is justified if it's probable or self-evident, as these latter terms just restate that there's something good knowledge-wise about the belief. Instead, just like an ethicist might want to try to define moral value in terms of non-moral properties (e.g. good = bringing maximum pleasure), he wants to define epistemic value in non-epistemic terms. It might be that (just as some philosophers claim about the moral case) that this simply isn't possible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the paper goes through and rejects many different possibilities for defining justification, and his solution is that a belief is justified if it is obtained using a reliable method, i.e. one that yields truth in most cases. Again, truth is not itself an epistemic term, but just a way of categorizing beliefs. This sounds weird, I know; aren't the true beliefs the good ones? Isn't "true" just a way of saying a belief is good? But not according to Goldman; a belief is true if it corresponds to some state of affairs in the world, and there's nothing inherently normative about that. Also, keep in mind, we're not saying that any belief is justified just because it's true; this was the whole thing Plato objected to (even a broken clock is right twice a day). We're saying that, for instance, if you carefully examine a physical object, and maybe confirm your observation with some other people, and again if it makes at a later time if it's possible to do so... All this is a pretty reliable way of determining at least obvious properties about that physical object (e.g. it's a good way of gaining true knowledge that a particular cat is on a mat at some particular time).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So justification and hence knowledge will be a matter of degree. For instance, testimony is a pretty good way of getting true knowledge, but because people lie, or we might misunderstand, it's not fool-proof.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Goldman's answer helps with some Gettier cases: If I look and see a red barn and think "this is a red barn," that's a pretty reliable way of getting knowledge, right? But if unbeknownst to me, I'm in a part of the country where there are many barn facades, so most "barns" I might look at in fact are not barns at all, then &lt;em &gt;in that situation &lt;/em &gt;, simply looking at what appears to be a barn and commenting on it as such ends up not being a reliable way of getting knowledge, because most times I do that, I will be wrong. It doesn't matter that I don't know this; Goldman's account is "externalist," in that it has to do with the actual knowledge situation and not just what I as believer am aware of about that. This example also shows that a "reliable method" needs to be carefully defined; the method of simple observation is reliable only if the situation has not been manipulated specifically to deceive, just as testimony is reliable only when the testifier is not lying.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Goldman's account actually has two parts: I've given a "base clause" for a belief's being justified, but then there's a "recursive clause," which just says that there can be a chain of beliefs, each based on the previous one. If the original one was attained using a method that tends toward truth, then any other belief that is entailed by the first one or otherwise connected to it by legit means (means tending toward truth), then it also counts as justified. This seems obvious, but such is analytic philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Some processes that don't tend to lead to reliable beliefs include wishful thinking and psychic clairvoyance. As &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reliabilism/" target="_blank"&gt;the Stanford article &lt;/a &gt;enumerates, subsequent philosophers argued a bit about these. What if we live in a world with a "helpful demon" that actually makes anything we wish for come true? In that case, we would be in a world where that sort of method was reliable. So we can either say, yes, in that world, such people can use that to ground knowledge, or we can say that we as theorists are referring to what is reliable in our world, so we'd say of that other world that those people still don't have knowledge (justification), even though the demon makes them lucky enough to be right.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Re. clairvoyance, what if someone claims to be clairvoyant, and their predictions invariably become true? Well, we could say yes, I guess if that's the case, that person and those relying on that person's utterances do have knowledge, or we could say that what gets defined as a "reliable process" depends on what people &lt;em &gt;think &lt;/em &gt;in general is reliable, and we don't think clairvoyance is legitimate, or we don't understand how it could be, which comes to the same thing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;: We're reading William James' &lt;em &gt;The Varieties of Religious Experience &lt;/em &gt;, concentrating on lectures 1-3 and 20.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?” (1963) by Edmund Gettier, “What Is Justified Belief?” (1979) by Alvin Goldman, and “The Inescapability of Gettier Problems” (1994) by Linda Zagzebski.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is knowledge? A formulation going back to Plato distinguishes between opinion and knowledge. Even if one's opinion is true, it's not knowledge if it lacks justification. In his famous three-page paper, Gettier showed that even if a belief is true and justified, in some cases we still wouldn't consider it knowledge. Suppose you tell me that you have COVID, and I have no reason to think you would lie, but in fact you are lying (you don't think you have COVID). Unbeknownst to you, you actually do have COVID. According to Gettier, even though I believe you have COVID with good reason (you told me so, and you've been trustworthy in the past), and even though my belief is true (you do have it), my reason is disconnected from what actually makes it true, so it's not knowledge.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This led many philosophers to try to determine how to characterize justification to avoid such cases. Goldman says that a person's belief has to have been caused by a "reliable cognitive process." In Gettier cases, it's merely luck that makes the belief true, which is not in general a great way to establish reliable beliefs. (You can't set out to be lucky, using luck as a tool to gain knowledge.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Zegzebski claims that as long as justification does not guarantee the truth of a belief (and it doesn't: even a belief that you have a very good reason to believe may in fact be wrong), then there's always a space where luck can turn a well-grounded belief false or turn one that should not count as knowledge true. Gettier problems are thus unavoidable, and that's OK.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/phys419/sp2019/Gettier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the Gettier paper &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://bigfatgenius.com/532%20Summer%202008/Zagzebski-Inescapability_Gettier_Problems.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Zagzebski's response to the literature on this &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Most of our discussion of &lt;a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/epistclass/goldmanjust.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the Goldman paper &lt;/a &gt;is in part two.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-343-plotinus-105881791"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;with guest Chris Sunami, mostly discussing "The Good or The One," though we start off by completing "The Descent of the Soul" about why there is something rather than nothing, given that materiality is so undesirable compared to The One.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is related to some other issues about how the Forms and matter interact. For Aristotle, each individual organism has an embedded Form, which is what makes it an entity at all, but for Plotinus, non-physical things like Forms are numerically identical if they don't have any properties. So the Form of humanity in Socrates and the one in me are different only because they have embedded themselves in those individuals, but considered separately, they are all not just identical but one and the same Form, which is why when we focus on what we have in common, ignoring all our material peculiarities, we can &lt;em &gt;feel &lt;/em &gt;that we are all One.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also, Plotinus says there are Forms not just for species like humanity but for individual, heritable characteristics, like the shape of one's nose. But we also know that a Form, as it is embodied, makes some compromises with matter, and so might in some cases result as deformed due to some biological accident in development. Is it always the case that variations in appearance (e.g. different skin tones, as our bodies produce melanin in response to different levels of sunlight) are hierarchical, i.e. one is the "real" instantiation of the Form, and one is a degraded version? Or are all material appearances of the Form compromised, just in different ways? How does this affect the issue of beauty, which Plotinus and Plato describe as us grasping the perfection of a true form through its partially realized material manifestation?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In discussing The One, Plotinus first tells us that we can't actually say anything about it, that it is better and beyond even Being. He then tells us that while we can't know it (which would require knowing the properties which it does not have), we can experience it mystically, so we talk about whether that kind of talk is useful to philosophers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next time: We're talking about the Gettier problem via "&lt;a href="https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/phys419/sp2019/Gettier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Is Justified True Belief Knowledge &lt;/a &gt;?" and some other articles.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On selections from the &lt;em &gt;Enneads &lt;/em &gt;(270 C.E.), as presented by Elmer O'Brien as the first four essays in &lt;em &gt;The Essential Plotinus &lt;/em &gt;: "Beauty," "The Intelligence, Ideas and Being," "The Descent of the Soul," and "The Good or The One." Featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, Seth, and guest &lt;a href="https://www.kitoba.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Sunami &lt;/a &gt;(editor of &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/book/" target="_blank"&gt;the PEL book &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is our metaphysical relationship to the good and the beautiful? 600 years after Plato, Plotinus has inherited Plato's views through the lens of Aristotle, so we get an interesting hybrid of the two that takes Plato's cosmological views in the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-264-platos-on-48193086"&gt;Timeaus &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-265-platos-as-48778010"&gt;Phaedo &lt;/a &gt;as straightforward, literal accounts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though Plotinus was a pre-Christian Roman, his vision of the material world as an imperfect, degraded copy of a pure, changeless, heavenly realm very much jibed with Christian thinking and so was influential on Middle Ages philosophy and was taken up wholly by Christian Neo-Platonists like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-298-marsilio-69472045"&gt;Ficino &lt;/a &gt;a millennium later). According to this cosmology, God is The One, as conceived by &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-197-on-what-20915665"&gt;Parmenides &lt;/a &gt;: Ultimate reality has to be entirely unified, which means we can't even attribute any properties to it (a property would be a part of something), not even of its having "being," so ultimately we can only talk about it in negative terms. But then there are intermediate divinities that we can know a lot about: The Intelligence (what Plato calls the Demiurge) is the source of all the Platonic Forms and is in effect the God that can actually create and do things, but He does this through The World-Soul, which in turn acts on (or through?) individual souls which provide the forms to matter (as Aristotle describes).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Just to schematize the four essays: #2 ("The Intelligence, Ideas and Being") lays out this hierarchy, while #4 ("The Good or The One") goes into detail about how even though the One can't be spoken of, we can still know it by realizing that we literally ARE it (along with everything else) through mystical experience (this part wasn't taken up so directly by Christianity, whose mysticism stresses that mortals are not themselves in any sense God; this is more like Eastern or Transcendentalist mysticism). #1 ("Beauty," which we really didn't get around to talking much about here) talks a la the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-100-platos-33200350"&gt;Symposium &lt;/a &gt;about how our knowledge and feelings can move up the hierarchy from physical to spiritual things, while #3 ("The Descent of the Soul") speculates about why a soul would metaphysically debase itself by becoming associated with lowly matter, which Plotinus seems to hold in contempt.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A point that Plotinus takes from Aristotle is seeing The One as an unmoved mover (which we discussed re. Aristotle in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-338-aristotle-100971632"&gt;#338 &lt;/a &gt;). Since the One can't do anything, and is literally us, or rather the special, spiritual core of us, we have to see our relation to The One as one of magnetic attraction in an orbit; The One is the center of us, and so the rest of your personality, the part compromised by its association with matter, metaphorically orbits around it, ever attracted by its greatness but unable to fully coincide with it, lest we all cease existing as distinct individuals. Of course, when we die, we can actually achieve our goal, our orbit decaying, allowing us to crash and merge into the divine. (The crashing image is of course not Plotinus' words; Dylan adds the metaphor of a tuning fork here; we vibrate in time with the Forms... though again, The One cannot itself vibrate or otherwise move or do anything.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plotinus stresses Plato's Pythagorean heritage. The numbers themselves are these abstract, otherworldly entities that do not ever themselves change but which provide patterns for lower things to accord (vibrate) with. As Aristotle pointed out (see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-335-aristotle-98156258"&gt;#335 &lt;/a &gt;), a number as static can't itself get things moving, so this is why we need in Plotinus' system The Intelligence as a dynamic entity that can get things moving, somehow reflecting The One in a way we can't understand. Using a metaphor from Plato's &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;, Plotinus says The One emits rays of Goodness like the sun, which on the Greek conception was an everlasting source, left totally unchanged by this discharge, yet changing all that the rays hit, making them more like the source (i.e. the sun warms us, The One makes The Intelligence qua The Good).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Using another metaphor, Plotinus describes the latter as "the vestibule to The One." The lack of a non-metaphorical account of the relation between The One and The Intelligence is a pretty glaring hole in the system, and Plotinus doesn't make as much of an effort as Aristotle to try to explain how a fundamental reality (The One or The Unmoved Mover) can be dynamic enough to kick off motion in the world, to effect the creation of things, or even to be related to some other nearly-as-divine entity that can do such things. Parmenides himself was aware of this problem, and this is why he posited that we can look at metaphysics from "the way of truth" (i.e. there's only truly a singular One) vs. "the way of seeming" (how we are forced the the nature of thinking to theorize about the cosmos, which involves two forces that can thus provide fundamental dynamism). However, it doesn't appear that Plotinus thinks that The Intelligence is merely some illusion, but it's part of his divine furniture, embodying The Good and in so doing supplying all of the other Platonic Forms. This will be a fundamental problem of any kind of monism, whether &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-24-spinoza-on-11380107"&gt;Spinoza's &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-270-classical-51713547"&gt;Vedic &lt;/a &gt;(i.e. Hindu): If there's ultimately only One, then why do so many things appear to us as distinct. (We just saw a different way that things could be One yet multiple in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-342-zhuangzi-104965414"&gt;Zhuangzi &lt;/a &gt;; they're not literally one but just interrelated and coming from the same ultimate source.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Chris our guest compares this metaphysical problem to the Problem of Evil: Given the ultimate perfection of the universe, why does anything distinct exist at all, when the interaction of distinct entities is what then unavoidably results in collisions that don't in themselves look like evidence of a grand, designed pattern? To answer a question we had about Platonic forms: Are there Forms of gross things like mud? Well, no: these are not natural kinds, as later philosophers might put it. You could have a nicely Formed (ensouled!) molecule, but if a bunch of these beauties clump together in an arbitrary way, you might get just a heap (mud) and not a proper entity at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plotinus' response to why this degradation from perfection to matter occurs is that something is not fully actualized until it springs out in material form, so it's part of the inherent nature of higher things (and ultimately The One) that they unfold, as sort of a gift to the universe, and that the good that comes out of this (the existence of the material world) is greater than the inevitable evils that come with embodiment. (For a more developed theodicy of this sort informed by Plotinus, see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-253-leibniz-42055569"&gt;Leibniz &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://hackettpublishing.com/the-essential-plotinus" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/essentialplotinu0000elme" target="_blank"&gt;try this version online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on "Martin Buber and the Theory of Knowledge," with two sections: "The Ontology of the Interval, or the 'Between'" and "Communication and Inclusion." &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We've been talking about how Buber and Levinas are trying to get us out of a first-person, Cartesian point of view, and now we finally get to how meeting another person is supposed to be ontologically fundamental for us. Your "self" is fundamentally something in relation to other people, not just for Hegelian reasons about how you only know you're a person if other people treat you that way, but because we are fundamentally in dialogue with others, which unifies us with them even as it asserts them as an irreducible Other whose otherness needs to be respected. This is the only kind of union worth anything, according to Levinas (contra an Emersonian or Eastern idea that we are literally the same organism).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/f/f9/The_Levinas_Reader_1989.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 65.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/104965414"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, still with Theo Brooks. We talk more about the metaphysical boundaries between things, which could less pretentiously be redescribed as an issue about whether words have clear and consistent meanings. Importantly, is there really a difference between "good" and "bad"? And are any of the Courses (Daos, Ways) really clearly defined (and should they be?): Zhuangzi has been clear that to follow a strict recipe for action, which is how Confucianism for one is often portrayed by Daoists, is to impose something foreign on yourself, but Zhuangzi's use of Confucius as a character suggests that Confucianism properly interpreted is, like Daoism, a type of virtue ethics wherein the Utmost Person will have the wisdom to react flexibly to novel situations, not just chant and enact rigid dogma. The Dao (our Course of action) can and should be a zig-zag path.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This leads us to the distinction between the human and the Heavenly. The latter is nature, which is our true origin and should be the guide for our action, whereas the "human" (The Chinese word here is "ren") is the social customs that we've come up with, which often pull us away from what's natural. So what does this natural/Heavenly way of being entail, in contrast to following explicit ethical commands? It's not just "do what you feel" and certainly not "follow you whims," but involves "nurturing life." Part of life, though, is death, and Zhuangzi's emphasis on the interrelatedness of all things means that nurturing life in general doesn't mean that you get really hung up on preserving your own life or the life of a specific loved one. So coupled with this idea referred to in part one of this discussion that Zhuangzi advocates real, face-to-face encounters (like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-71-martin-i-17046654"&gt;Buber &lt;/a &gt;!), is a Stoic acknowledgment that all in this material world is fleeting, and (like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-201-marcus-22279068"&gt;Marcus Aurelius &lt;/a &gt;in particular) we're part of a great natural system whose directives dwarf our puny, individualistic objections about right and wrong, fair and unfair. So does this lead the Daoist to quietism, or worse, to a lack of moral grounding?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next time &lt;/strong &gt;: We're reading the first four essays in &lt;a href="https://hackettpublishing.com/the-essential-plotinus" target="_blank"&gt;The Essential Plotinus &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Since the episode ran a bit short, Mark wraps up with some announcements:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Subscribe to (and please rate and review!) the new public Closereads feed at &lt;a href="https://closereadsphilosophy.com" target="_blank"&gt;closereadsphilosophy.com &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Information on our book is available at &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/book" target="_blank"&gt;partiallyexaminedlife.com/book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Details on Mark's fall course will be at &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/class" target="_blank"&gt;partiallyexaminedlife.com/class &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Listen to Mark's new band (including the ending song to this episode, "I Insist," at &lt;a href="https://marklint.bandcamp.com" target="_blank"&gt;marklint.bandcamp.com &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Subscribe to Mark's substack for monthly updates about all these kinds of doings at &lt;a href="https://marklinsenmayer.substack.com" target="_blank"&gt;marklinsenmayer.substack.com &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, and Dylan are joined again by Theo Brooks to further explore this classic Daoist text, now covering books 1-6 (and parts of 17-19), which brings together the material covered for &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-341-guest-lai-104091587"&gt;ep. 341 &lt;/a &gt;with what a couple of us previously discussed back in 2009 on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-12-chuang-is-30313427"&gt;ep. 12 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start with an extended discussion of the "happy fish" story, which comes at the end of book 17 and is about knowledge. How do I know your mind, and vice versa, and can either of us know a fish's mind? Zhuangzi (like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-32-heidegger-11381085"&gt;Heidegger &lt;/a &gt;) seems to say that skepticism about such things makes no sense; our position in the world presupposes that there are other subjectivities that we can know quite a bit about. Though someone might fool us sometimes about their mental state (not a fish, that has no capacity to deceive), our minds are largely part of the public world. We each have a unique perspective on this world, but we also have the ability to change our perspectives and so (maybe) understand others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This positive statement about our ability to know, however, is undermined by Zhuangzi's &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-324-platos-on-88663358"&gt;Cratylus &lt;/a &gt;-like position whereby the things that our words purport to pick out are constantly changing, so we can't claim any firm, foundational knowledge about the things we experience. Zhuangzi thinks that philosophy of that sort is groundless and pretentious. In the text (Ch. 33, as Theo mentions), Zhuangzi makes fun of his interlocutor from the fish story, Huizi, by describing the latter's philosophy: "Hui Shi had many theories: his writings filled five carts. But his course was uneven and mottled, and his words were wide of the mark." The chapter describes Huizi as using these theories to make himself famous and inspire lots of useless debate.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These epistemic concerns lead us to then talk about ethics: Does Zhuangzi's Daoism require us to be compassionate to one another? Certainly we need not follow ethical rules a la Confucius, but Daoism does countenance having real encounters with one another, whereas the abstractions of ethical rules might actually blind us to others' concrete reality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Daoist virtue thus has to do flexibly being able to move between perspectives so as to keep centered in reality. And what is "reality," given that things are constantly changing? It's a dynamic reality, where each thing has its own natural pattern of growth (telos, to use the Greek word), and the goal is to recognize that in others, and to retain the suppleness so that you can effectively grow yourself in whatever environment you find yourself. Ironically, the most effective way to become yourself (to grow in the most natural, healthy way) is to lose yourself (to stop trying to cultivate your growth along predetermined lines as Confucianism recommends).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Metaphysically, reality involves the interpenetration of opposites. The concept "horse" for instance, is only defined in terms of its contrast to non-horses, so in essence the horse is carrying around non-horseness with it. You can't think of a horse, and a horse itself cannot exist, in isolation from its opposite. More precisely, by indicating an individual being, you're breaking it out from a background, and so you're implicating (implicitly pointing out) all that cannot be pointed out, all that can't be articulated because it isn't an object at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is the first of two discussions we're recording on the 4th century BCE Chinese text Zhuangzi. Mark, Dylan, Seth, and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-311-dao-de-78938493"&gt;returning guest &lt;/a &gt;Theo Brooks are joined for this hour by &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/karyn-lai" target="_blank"&gt;UNSW Sydney professor Karyn Lai &lt;/a &gt;to discuss how to read this text, whether and how Daoists should engage with political matters, and what Zhuangzi's model of virtue is. This is our first foray back to this text since 2009's &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-12-chuang-is-30313427"&gt;episode 12 &lt;/a &gt;, and we chose largely different chapters this time: 4, 5, and 19.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As with the &lt;em &gt;Dao De Jing &lt;/em &gt;and Laozi, we don't really know if this was written by a single person (it probably wasn't), and don't know whether Zhuangzi was a real person, must less the author of this. Sometimes Zhuangzi appears as a character as if (like the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-159-confucius-51032578"&gt;Analects &lt;/a &gt;) this were a collection of the master's teachings. Sometimes in the chapters we chose, the main character is Confucius himself, so we discuss whether these appearances are meant to show that Confucius was wrong, or that perhaps he did or should have accepted the superiority of Daoism over Confucianism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whereas Confucianism purportedly gives us a specific Dao or Way (or Course, in the 2020 translation by Brook Ziporyn that we all used at Karyn's suggestion) to order our lives, Daoism says that strictly following such a recipe constitutes overlaying something foreign on our constitutions. We're better off following our own personal destiny, being open to the environment and other people to determine what to do next. while retaining our personal integrity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ch. 4 connects the Zhuangzi to the past Chinese texts that purport to advise political leaders and advisors. Instead of directly providing advice, Zhuangzi includes anecdotes of people asking for advice (typically from Confucius). Really, the Daoist should just avoid political service (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TM1LH9BtM9I?si=Wgte1Q9HqSIk6wbo" target="_blank"&gt;as Zhuangzi himself supposedly did &lt;/a &gt;), but if you are going to advise a (probably very flawed) ruler, you need to be careful, because you'll want to be honest and flaunt your virtue, but this will probably get you executed. Confucius (the character) points out a disabled person who everyone is attracted to even though this person doesn't actually teach anything. This is one of many demonstrations of the virtue of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei" target="_blank"&gt;wu wei &lt;/a &gt;, the idea of accomplishing without action, just by being authentically yourself, following the course of nature. Confucius refers to a practice of "fasting the mind," which is emptying ideology (like the Confucian Dao) out of your mind so you can better listen to nature and engage in wu wei.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ch. 5 includes several stories about disabled people (mostly those who got a foot chopped off as punishment for some crime) who nonetheless are wiser than Confucius. We talk a bit about perspectivism and get a bit into Ch. 19 about people who become very graceful at mundane physical tasks.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Karyn is co-authoring &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/series/classical-chinese-philosophy" target="_blank"&gt;the Chinese philosophy portion of the History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://hackettpublishing.com/zhuangzi-the-complete-writings" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the translation we read &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://terebess.hu/english/zipo.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In ep. 342 (a regular, two-part discussion with Theo but without Karyn), we'll continue considering these chapters but will also add back ch. 2, 3, and 6 that were officially covered for our first treatment of the book in ep. 12. (Theo's audio will be higher fidelity for that discussion.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

This continues from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/103234794"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, but listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-339-brian-on-101920316"&gt;ep. 339 &lt;/a &gt;first.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are we OK with the idea that our natural laws must be the same in all possible worlds, i.e. the ones that have the same THINGS in it that our world does? This change ends up negating the entire program of 20th century logical construction (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-67-carnap-on-17045971"&gt;Carnap &lt;/a &gt;), which maybe is not a great loss. How do Ellis' mind-independent fundamental objects in the world relate to higher level things, whether biological species or human nature or even things like colors?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next time, we're talking about the Daoist philosopher Zhuangzi, previously covered in &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/12/06/episode-12-chuang-tzus-taoism-what-is-wisdom/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 12 &lt;/a &gt;. We're using &lt;a href="https://hackettpublishing.com/zhuangzi-the-complete-writings" target="_blank"&gt;the Brook Ziporyn translation &lt;/a &gt;(2020), covering primarily the "inner chapters" (1-7).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on &lt;em &gt;The Philosophy of Nature: A Guide to the New Essentialism &lt;/em &gt;(2002), now featuring Wes, Seth, Dylan (our resident physicist returns!), and guest Chris Heath.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Essentialism, as described in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-339-brian-on-101920316"&gt;ep. 339 &lt;/a &gt;, is the metaphysical doctrine that there are objective natural kinds in the world, at least at the level of physics and chemistry. No "social construction" or anything like that goes into the fact that the the atoms of the various elements are irreducibly different. So what are the implications of this seemingly common sense observation for philosophy?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For one thing, to define what a thing is, we have to say what its dispositions are: What it IS to be a hydrogen atom, for instance, is to react in certain predictable ways with other atoms in various situations. Second, natural laws aren't metaphysically fundamental, but are just descriptions characterizing these behaviors and dispositions of things. Third, these laws of nature must be true in all possible worlds: They are metaphysically necessary, given that the natural-kind entities that they describe necessarily behave the way they do.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Most of the above was actually already covered in ep. 339, so we're just getting clearer on that so far in part one here. In the final part this discussion, we talk more widely about the scientific and philosophical implications of the theory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're reading a 1984 essay by Mark's U. of Michigan undergrad advisor, included among the most cited philosophy papers in some list that Wes found. Railton's goal is to give a naturalistic account of ethics (i.e. ethics within a framework of natural science) that both connects tightly to observed empirical facts and also makes moral facts real parts of our world, not merely reducible to non-moral facts about pleasure, social norms, or the like.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this first part, Railton lays out what naturalism in ethics amounts to and begins to explain why past empiricists like Hume don't provide an account of morality that is adequately normative: Merely describing what people tend to shoot for doesn't explain why such a norm is binding on us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.filosoficas.unam.mx/docs/1110/files/Railton%20Moral%20realism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Seth, Dylan, and our guest book editor Chris Sunami reflect on a decade and a half doing this podcast and the making of &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/book/" target="_blank"&gt;our new book &lt;/a &gt;, which you should order exactly on its release date of Thursday, April 25, so we can all drive it up the bestseller list.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The book is a fine way to revisit some classic episodes in a fresh form, and brings together our various celebrity contacts, big-time philosopher author-guests, and treatments of canonically central and marginalized philosophers. Chris' editor voice is not subtle: He inserts himself as a post-hoc participant to move the dialogue between topics. There are also some supporting essays and lots of great graphics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Do you remember the three rules for PEL discussion? Do we? Why don't we actually create transcripts for all our episodes? Can there be a PEL card game?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Philosophy of Nature: A Guide to the New Essentialism &lt;/em &gt;(2002), featuring Mark, Wes, Seth, and guest Chris Heath. What kind of metaphysics underlies chemistry and physics? Ellis says that mainstream philosophy of science is still under the spell of Descartes, Newton, and their contemporaries, especially Hume.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to this view, the fundamental metaphysical entities are just passive entities with shape, which are then manipulated by forces. Laws of nature, according to Hume, are just brute, inexplicable correlations between events. Ellis wants to argue, following Aristotle, that the basic metaphysical entities are dynamic. They have inherent dispositions to behave in certain ways, and those dispositions and other essential properties are what make those things what they are. A nominalist about electrons, for instance, might say that we talk about electrons just as a shorthand of modeling a lot of complex observational data. Ellis says on the contrary that electrons are real entities, defined by their charge and other behaviors. Anything that did not behave that way would not be an electron. These basic entities and processes are real, they act the way they do necessarily, and scientific laws are just a way we describe their activity. This means that scientific laws, too, are necessary: There is no possible world in which they could work differently than they do, unless there were different fundamental entities and processes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One key implication of this is that there are natural kinds: groupings of things that are given by the things themselves, not just about our semi-arbitrary customary ways of grouping them. For instance, the chemical elements are absolutely, objectively distinct from each other and precisely defined via their atomic numbers. Per &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-128-hilary-on-50433295"&gt;our Putnam episode &lt;/a &gt;, water is essentially H2O, so if some other world had a different substance served the identical functional role that water has here, and had the appearance of water, so that visitors from our world to that world mistook it for water, yet that substance had a different molecular makeup, then that would not be water. Whereas Plato and Aristotle thought that essences are something we intuitively grasp when we understand what water (or whatever) is, Ellis (and Putnam and Kripke) see essences as something science has to discover, i.e. as a posteriori.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This doesn't mean that all of our concepts represent natural kinds. Ellis says that while there are many predicates, only some of them represent properties, which are real things in the world. So you might think that being fragile is obviously a property that fragile things have, but for Ellis, this is a concept covering numerous different structural features that could cause something to easily break. So fragility is not a property at all, according to Ellis' technical use of the word "property."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You also might think that an animal would have an essence, i.e. its DNA. While an individual has such an essence, a species does not, as members of a species will have differences in their DNA, so a species is not defined precisely enough to be a a natural kind. As Darwin theorized, there is no sharp line between species, as small variations are introduced throughout a species' history until a species has gradually morphed into something else.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Of course it's still useful for us to refer to particular species or properties like fragility, but these concepts really are grouped according to human needs, whereas the truly natural kinds are independent of human minds and needs. This is enough to ground an metaphysical objectivity: It is not the case according to Ellis that humans synthesize our worlds including all of our scientific models. If we're doing science correctly, we're reading these essential properties off of the world, not imposing them on it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Nature-Guide-New-Essentialism/dp/0773524746" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophyofnatu0000elli" target="_blank"&gt;check out this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;To conclude our discussion of Aristotle's &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;, we finish discussing potency by talking about our potential to learn, i.e. the Meno problem: How can we learn something (have the potential to know it) unless we already in some sense know it? Aristotle dismisses this as "sophistical": we have the potential to kick off the learning process and then actually learn through habituating to thing we're trying to learn (which itself pre-exists our attempt to learn it, e.g. the art of flute playing exists before I try to learn it).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then finish up "priority in substantiality"; which is metaphysically primary, the chicken or the egg? It's the chicken, because it has the completed form.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Moving on to book 12, we talk about the whole universe and eternal entities as also being primary being, not just animals and plants. What makes the universe itself strive toward its own completion? Aristotle says that the universe is actively trying to be like the unmoved mover, which is a concept of God as pure thought.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/100971632"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, or better yet, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-335-aristotle-98156258"&gt;ep. 335 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;: We're reading &lt;a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/ELLTPO-19" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Ellis' The Philosophy of Nature: A Guide to the New Essentialism &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;For our fourth and final discussion of Aristotle's &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;, Mark, Wes, and Dylan read portions of books 9 (Theta) and 12 (Lambda). The first of these covered Aristotle's notion of energeia, sometimes translated as actuality, but by our translator Joe Sachs as "being-at-work." An example of this is eudaimonia, the word we've discussed as the goal of ancient Greek ethics: "flourishing" or "happiness." Relatedly, the obscure English word "entelechy" was Aristotle's original word that (entelechia) that combines the very relevant notion of telos (an end, i.e. purpose) with the Greek word for persistence (endelechia), which Sachs translates as "being-at-work-staying-the-same." This is the final piece in Aristotle's characterization of what being amounts to: the primary beings (individual plants and animals) doing the things characteristic of what kind of beings they are.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The contrast is to mere potency or potential (the Greek is "dunamis"; you can look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality" target="_blank"&gt;this wiki page &lt;/a &gt;to get all these Greek words straight). One question we start with is whether the notion of potency is actually explanatory in any way: Why does an acorn grown into an oak tree? "Because it has the potential (or we could say "the power") to do so." This type of answer seems to give us no specific information.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These concepts are supposed to enable us to better talk about causality and change. For causality to occur, the cause needs to have the potential to cause, and the effected object needs to have the potentiality to be effected in that way. Something self-moving (a plant or animal) has its own potential to grow into its next form, so long as nothing is preventing it from doing so (e.g. a lack of nutrition).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Book 12 is about the famous cosmological argument by which Aristotle proves the existence of God by saying that there has to be something that kicked off the whole chain of causation. However, this can't itself be something that moves, i.e. something that has any potency at all; God must be fully actual all the time, and so really be standing outside the chain of efficient causes (outside time?). Instead, this fundamental type of causality that makes all other causality possible is more like that of a magnet, where all things are "oriented" or "revolve around" this Unmoved Mover, which Aristotle peculiarly thinks must be "thought thinking itself." This is essentially the same as the Form of the Good for Plato, though it's supposed to be somehow more dynamic (which seems to contradict the idea that it doesn't move). All things in their growth and development are essentially striving toward the Good: toward their own fullness and completion. Is this really a better explanation for how movement gets kicked off in the universe than the supposedly static explanations provided by Plato (the Forms) or other ancient cosmologists (e.g. the four elements themselves inherently contain movement), as we discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-335-aristotle-98156258"&gt;episode 335 &lt;/a &gt;as the first topic explored in this book?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In any case, focusing on God is supposed to complete Aristotle's consideration of how to characterize metaphysics: the nature of Being, since God (if there is one) would of course be primary among beings metaphysically, even if it's the individual plants and animals he's been calling primary being, because it's their being that enables us to &lt;em &gt;understand &lt;/em &gt;the rest of being.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.instagram.com/sterlingbartlett" target="_blank"&gt;Sterling Bartlett &lt;/a &gt;.

How do they get them? Well, they're received from some previous thing that has a comparable form, e.g. a child from its parents, or perhaps a form could come from a creator's mind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks for listening to this most essential episode (in that it's about essences, a topic that is probably optional at best).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing for our third session on Aristotle's &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;, now covering Book 7 (Zeta). &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-335-aristotle-98156258" target="_blank"&gt;Start your journey with ep. 335 &lt;/a &gt;. We're back to the full four hosts for this discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-336-aristotle-99155611"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;, we explained Aristotle's position about how to talk about being (what it is for something to exist), which, since it doesn't actually contrast with anything (not even nothingness, which is just defined as a different being than you were looking for), seems like it should be indescribable. But we learned that Aristotle thought that some instances of being are what being is really all about (things), while others (properties, relations, absences, etc.) are only being because they're related to the things in the first category.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also learned that being means being something specific, something defined. So how can we describe these primary beings? What distinguishes an individual one of these? What about it makes it primary and determines what exactly it is? Aristotle considers various possibilities: Is it the substratum, i.e. whatever it is that has the various properties? For Aristotle, this would be matter: a bronze statue is basically a lump of bronze that then has the form of a statue, so you might think the matter is primary, and the form is just a set of attributes, along with the location of the statue, its color, its weight, etc. Aristotle rejects this theory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Could it be the form in the sense that Plato described it? &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/closereads-forms-98156973"&gt;As we discussed &lt;/a &gt;, Aristotle doesn't understand how an individual thing could be related to its form if forms are external to the things. (For Plato, Forms were primary being, physical objects only secondarily so.) The answer ends up being "substantial forms": the essence of the statue is its form as it is instantiated in that particular statue. But really, statues don't have forms, because the form is also supposed to have causal power. In the case of plants and animals, the form of the entity makes it what it is, determines how it will change and grow, and accounts for its identity over time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For a person, the substantial form, the person's essence, is that person's humanity: the form of rational animal. So interestingly, even though Socrates' form can be described as "rational animal," and Wes' form can also be described in this same way, they are clearly different people. The form as described doesn't distinguish one person from another, but each person has a numerically unique substantial form: one rational animal here, another there, another for each of us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle also has to explain why this personal substantial form is metaphysically basic. It seems like a human has many parts: bones, blood, viscera, etc. Why aren't these parts more basic? Or the definition itself, "rational animal"; doesn't that have two parts, rational and animal? Why aren't those basic?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle says that those parts really only make sense in light of the whole. Creation of the whole is the point when that individual thing comes into existence. The component matter that makes us up and the component concepts that make up the definition of our form are not primary, with their compounds being secondary. Instead, the individual animal or plant is primary being, whose essence is described by its definition. A person is not just an amalgam of organs, but instead a hand, for instance, is defined by the purpose it serves in the larger system that is the person.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on "Two Concepts of Liberty" (1969), we finish up the negative conception ("freedom from") and give Berlin's strange account of positive freedom ("freedom to"), which involves an identification of some part of you (e.g. for Plato, your rationality), the obeying of which makes you free, even if what you "want" goes against this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Berlin_Liberty.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on p. 20.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

We discuss the relation between the logical principle that no statement or belief can legitimately contradict itself and the metaphysical principle that something can't both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle argues against the relativists of his day, such as Protagoras whose famous doctrine is "man is the measure of all things." Aristotle interprets this as saying that whatever seems true to someone is in fact true. Because people disagree, this belief implies a denial of the law of non-contradiction. I not only believe that I'm right, but I believe that your opposing view is wrong, and you believe likewise, so if we're both in fact right, then you're both right and wrong, speaking truly and falsely in the very same statement. But is this a charitable take on relativism?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next time we'll be reading Book 7.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Aristotle’s &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;, book 4 (aka Gamma) (ca. 340 BCE), featuring Mark, Wes, and Dylan. Our treatment of this book starts with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-335-aristotle-98156258"&gt;the previous episode &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What does studying “being” entail? When we study a particular kind of thing, e.g. an animal species, we say things about it that distinguish it from other animals, and animals from other types of things. But since everything counts as “being,” then it’s hard to see what we could possibly say about what it is for something to be.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle’s solution is to say that to be is to be a distinct individual of a certain type. This contrasts with the view of reality as flux (attributed to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-324-platos-on-88663358"&gt;Cratylus &lt;/a &gt;, following Heraclitus) which says being is just a constantly shifting mass, and that when we name things, we’re erroneously pointing at some part of this mass and pretending that it’s stable. If something is a distinct individual, then we can state true facts about it, or alternatively misdescribe it, i.e. utter falsehoods. So even though you might have thought the principle of non-contradiction was a purely logical notion about propositions (a proposition can’t be both true and false at the same time), this logical point is derived from a metaphysical point: It’s not possible for the same thing to both belong and not belong to the same thing, at the same time and in the same respect. Some individual both be a boat and not a boat, though conceivably something (some wood and nails) could become a boat, or something could be a boat in some respects but not in others (a model boat).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle says that we can’t prove the principle of non-contradiction, because any proof would make use of that principle, and so be circular. There must be some place that inquiry stops. However, he’s comfortable showing that the alternative views have absurd consequences, so this goes some way to providing an indirect proof.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So if something is (is real), it’s a distinct individual, and so subject to the principle of non-contradiction, but is &lt;em &gt;everything &lt;/em &gt;a distinct individual? Not exactly: Everything must be either be an individual, unified substance (Aristotle calls this primary being) or related to (dependent on) a substance, like an attribute, relation, an idea about the relation, etc. So everything real partakes of being, but some things have more being than others, or rather they are paradigm cases of being or merely derived cases. Even an absence can be a being, because (per &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-143-platos-on-50891432"&gt;Plato’s &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-143-platos-on-50891432"&gt;Sophist &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;), an absence of one thing that you were expecting means the presence of something else.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/98156258"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on Aristotle’s &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;, book 1. We get seriously into Aristotle’s four types of causation and how previous philosophers in leaving out one or most of these made a mistake. This includes a critique of Platonic forms, which as eternal, unchanging patterns can’t actually explain why change occurs in the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Parmenides famously only thought there was one fundamental, unchanging substance, but when talking about the experienced world, he expanded this to saying we need to talk about light and dark. So are these material substances (like fire and air), or are they forces? Either way, for Aristotle, their presence can’t adequately explain “being-at-work” in the world: the fact that things don’t just exist, and don’t just move randomly, but move in purposeful, often predictable ways.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As a third part of this, Mark and Wes have recorded a more detailed treatment of Aristotle’s arguments in this book against Platonic forms. This discussion is the first of (we think) four that we’ll be having about this book. For next episode, we’re reading book 4 (Gamma).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you enjoy this episode, try our past episodes on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-79-heraclitus-27507479"&gt;Heraclitus &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-279-of-being-57212449"&gt;Aristotle’s &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-279-of-being-57212449"&gt;Categories &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-197-on-what-20915665"&gt;Parmenides &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-198-platos-in-21178125"&gt;Plato’s dialogue &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-198-platos-in-21178125"&gt;The Parmenides &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Aristotle’s &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;, book 1 (aka Alpha) (ca. 340 BCE). What constitutes a basic explanation of the universe? Featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle famously give us four types of causation; the Greek word is “aitia,” which is perhaps better translated as “explanation,” and in this book, Aristotle (or whoever put this book together based on Aristotle’s teachings) considers the work of past philosophers to see if the types of explanations they give are sufficient.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For instance, Thales said that everything is fundamentally made of water, and other Pre-Socratics likewise argued that there is some one (or two or three) fundamental material types of stuff. But these explanations, says Aristotle, can’t explain why change occurs. He similarly criticizes the Pythagoreans who say that numbers are somehow the fundamental constituents of the world. Since numbers are static, how can they explain how things in the world get moving? This is why other philosophers such as Empedocles introduced two warring forces as the fundamental explanation of the world, such as love and strife. This too is still not a complete account of the “why” of things, for Aristotle; we’re going to need all four of his type of explanation: not just the material causes (the fundamental matter that makes things up) and the efficient cause (what sets something moving), but also a formal cause (what makes something have the pattern it has; this is where Plato’s forms will come in, and Aristotle’s revisions of that doctrine) and final cause (the purpose for which something comes into being; also relevant to the form, which is not just a matter of the structure of something, but what it’s internally trying to become, such as an acorn “trying” to become a tree, and an eye being designed to effectively see).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We actually spend most of our time in this first half talking about not metaphysics but epistemology: What kind of knowledge of something do we consider most comprehensive and wise? Following Plato, Aristotle criticizes people for merely having techne, which is experiential knowledge that allows them to work with some material, such as knowing how best to raise horses or build boats through having simply done a lot of this and learned practical techniques. As good an artisan as someone with this kind of knowledge might be, Aristotle claims that we regard a greater understanding than this as including the theoretical underpinnings of these practical endeavors:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We officially read the &lt;a href="https://www.greenlion.com/books/Metaphysics.html" target="_blank"&gt;Joe Sachs translation &lt;/a &gt;(1999). Many of us also read the relevant portions of &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Philosophy-GuideBook-to-Aristotle-and-the-Metaphysics/Politis/p/book/9780415251488" target="_blank"&gt;Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Aristotle and the Metaphysics &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;by Vasilis Politis (2004).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

First, we anticipate our first Aristotle &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;reading by talking about translations, ancient philosophy students, and whether this text is timeless, or is really a text intended for publication at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Second, we respond to some viewers who pointed us to the &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-identity-trap/id1651876897?i=1000638539196" target="_blank"&gt;Books That Kill podcast’s discussion &lt;/a &gt;of Mounk’s &lt;em &gt;Identity &lt;/em &gt;book, which we covered in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-328-guest-one-91794964" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 328 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we talk a bit about Presidential disqualification, how we’re not actually going to go fascist (one way or the other), and about our travels. Maybe you should come to Austin for the eclipse in April!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-334-gabriel-96947516"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "On the Ontological Mystery" (1933), we talk more about problems (the character of whose solution is pre-defined) vs. mysteries (the dense conundrums of experience like "How free is my will?" and "How is real intimacy possible?"). Re. the problem of evil: A theodicy like Leibniz's treats this as a puzzle to be solved in terms of the logically possible will of God (allowing evil to optimize overall good). But for Marcel, this approach doesn't take evil seriously enough: Once evil affects you directly, you feel its presence in a deep way, and this can't merely be banished by abstract argumentation. This is the characteristic of mystery: We are not mere observers, but are directly involved, and this complicates the inquiry.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Instead of trying to unravel and solve mysteries, we just cope with them, and for Marcel, we do this through recollection, which is a meditative way of pulling oneself out of the circumstance we were formerly in the midst of so as to be able to examine it. He sees this as very different from the jarring character of abstraction.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As another example, what is love? To be a Freudian or other type of analyst who reduces love to libido, to survival mechanism, or anything like that, is to falsify what love as experience is.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes Marcel an existentialist? Like Kierkegaard, he talks about how despair and the recognition of absurdity can give rise to a leap to hope and faith. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-87-sartre-on-30337379"&gt;Sartre &lt;/a &gt;, there's good reason for us to take this leap; Marcel's existentialism doesn't mean that the movement away from nihilism is entirely unmotivated, or free in a vertiginous sense. If you think carefully about your life, a key datum is "you are not your own" (a quote from the Apostle Paul), and once you realize this deeply, you won't be tempted to kill yourself or otherwise fall into despair.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about Being (how much is Marcel just parroting Heidegger?), pride, creativity, faith (does Marcel help us understand Kierkegaard?), being present to another person (what are ways that therapists, for instance, might or might not meet Marcel's requirements?), and how Christianity is actually involved with all of this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Episode &lt;/strong &gt;: We're starting in on Aristotle's Metaphysics, and will follow St. John's College reading list to do this over three episodes, the first of which will be on Book I (Α): 1–7 (980a21–988b22) and II (α): (993a30–995a20). We're all reading &lt;a href="https://hackettpublishing.com/nicomachean-ethics-3201" target="_blank"&gt;the Joe Sachs translation &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing "On the Ontological Mystery" (1933) about our need for meaning, featuring Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan. Against the emphasis in our lives on our functions (our jobs and duties) and our technological approach to problems that stresses practical solutions, Marcel asserts that we all have an "ontological need," which is a need for some content in our lives that is not merely accidental and contingent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Marcel distinguishes "problems" that we've broken down into elements that can be analyzed and solved technologically from "mysteries" that are the problems in our lives that have not been falsified through analysis. These are more fundamental, "meta-problematical," and required as an underlying ground for the more technical approach.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These mysteries include all the perennial philosophical problems, including what the value of life is, the mind-body relation, the problem of evil, true love, and more. For example, what is hope? Marcel says that hope is an assertion that "there is at the heart of being, beyond all data, beyond all inventories and all calculations, a mysterious principle which is in connivance with me, which cannot but will that which I will, if what I will deserves to be willed and is, in fact, willed by the whole of my being" (p. 28). So if your loved one is gravely ill, you might hope (have faith) that they will be OK, despite the data. We have a fundamental need for feelings of this sort, and if we insist on being "reasonable" in such a circumstance and merely looking objectively at the likelihood of a positive outcome, we're missing out on something, being less than human.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The technical point of view is very valuable, but we need to understand that it's not our originary position as human beings, but an abstraction that we engage in for particular purposes. This originary position is not merely a primitive state that the scientific worldview has overcome, but is fundamental such that we can't even think scientifically if we weren't also underlyingly in this less articulated position.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though Marcel is Christian, Christianity comes up explicitly only in a small way in this essay. For instance, he places great importance to the idea of "presence," giving the example that some people that you talk to really are present to you: It's not &lt;em &gt;just &lt;/em &gt;that they're listening carefully or willing to help. Someone can do those latter things and yet still not be present to you, not really available, not making a human connection. Marcel then uses this idea of presence to talk about our relation to the dead: Having a dead loved one continue to be an active force in your life is not just about preserving a static memory of them, like a photograph. The fundamental notion of "Being With" is possible not just between people but with the dead. Clearly Marcel wants to extend this to be able to admit that God is simply "present" to a faithful believer, but he doesn't actually use that example in the text.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://clunymedia.com/products/the-philosophy-of-existence" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophyofexis0000gabr" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;. It's the first essay in a collection that includes (in the second essay) a specific critique of Sartre, so that makes it clear how Marcel's existentialism is not Sartre's.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude our reading of "The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate," ch. 2: "The Moral Teaching of Jesus: The Sermon on the Mount Contrasted with the Mosaic Law and with Kant’s Ethics," discussing wealth, "judge not yet you be judged," and the final section of The Sermon on the Mount, which includes law-like pronouncements that seem to contradict Hegel's interpretation of Jesus as wanting us to transcend law (Kantian ethics) through love.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're sharing this episode among the full Citizenry even though it's part five in a series because a) you won't need to hear the rest of the series to understand it, and b) we use the end of our time here to connect this reading to our recent Kierkegaard &lt;em &gt;Fear and Trembling &lt;/em &gt;and forthcoming Marcel PEL episodes. Is love the kind of positively individualistic attitude that Kierkegaard has in mind when he says that faith transcends the ethical? Marcel puts this in terms of presence: A person (or God?) can be present before us in an undeniable way, and this affects us in a way different than the mediated relations to people that ethics provides.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://hegel.net/hegelwerke/Hegel1948-OnChristianity-EarlyTheologicalWritings.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Hegel along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting PDF p. 240 (text p. 222).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-333-fear-and-96076296"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on Kierkegaard’s perhaps most famous book, how focusing largely on the section called “Problem One: Is There a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?”&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kierkegaard (writing as Johannes de Silentio) describes this “unmediated” access to God that constitutes faith. It’s not obeying moral law (which would be a mediator), which characterizes tragic heroes who also kill their kids, such as Agamemnon in the &lt;em &gt;Iliad &lt;/em &gt;, who sacrifices one moral rule (don’t kill your kid) for a greater, but still public moral rule (do what provides greater good for society).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Abraham’s act of faith, by contrast, suspends all ethical considerations in favor of a private end (telos): one that is just between him and God. One could explain what happened as a “trial,” and perhaps even describe the duty to obey God as an ethical one, just as easily explainable to others as any other ethical dilemma (so if you were faced with this command, you’d do the same). Kierkegaard thinks this act of translating faith to something publicly explainable falsifies it. The moment of faith (on this account) is fundamentally singular, individual, and paradoxical.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One possible interpretation here is a Nietzschean, pluralistic virtue ethics, according to which there are various incommensurable ways of being virtuous. Being ethical in the traditional sense is one way of being good, and being faithful is another way, and the two ways might conflict (though in practice they rarely do).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We decided not to do a second episode on the second half of this book. Instead, next time we’re covering a 1993 paper “The Ontological Mystery,” by the French, Christian existentialist Gabriel Marcel, who among other topics covers hope and “creative fidelity,” which is how he describes faith.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ending our treatment of Soren Kierkegaard, we consider the religious stage of personal development through consideration of this 1843 text analyzing the Biblical story of Abraham faithfully following God’s directive to sacrifice his long-promised, much-cherished son Isaac. Can we observers possibly understand that kind of faith?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This text was released close on the heels of &lt;em &gt;Either/Or &lt;/em &gt;, and we were interested in reading it as a third book of that, showing how the religious stage advances on the ethical which had previously advanced on the aesthetic. In moving to the ethical stage, an individual comes to define himself not just in terms of his private standards (his perceptions of beauty) but in social, i.e. universal terms. Any lapse from the universal is from the ethical standpoint seen as sin. But in the case of Abraham, his call to this horrific act (which he didn’t end up having to go through with, but that’s beside the point) was entirely private. It could not be “justified” insofar as justification refers to publicly available norms. If he was tempted to ignore God’s call, that would not be a lapse into private desire, i.e. sin (though of course he did personally love his son), but it would be a “lapse” into the ethical, into recognition of the normal ethical law that you don’t kill the innocent, don’t betray your duty to your child, etc. So Kierkegaard (or rather his avatar for this book, Johannes de Silentio) asks whether the ethical can be suspended due to a justification that is purely private? Where the individual for the ethical person was superseded by the universal, can this again be superseded by the individual in the act of faith?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This makes it sound like the religious stage is a synthesis of the previous stage. We get back some of the passion and individuality back from the aesthetic stage. However, K’s account of the ethical stage was already pretty complete. It was not about effacing your individuality in favor of the faceless universal, but about defining yourself as an authentic individual within a social context: We can only be individuals in the context of real relationships with others, and real relationships are different than merely (a la Kant) imagining that your actions are guided by universal laws; that’s more like acting in parallel with other people than actually relating to them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;Fear and Trembling &lt;/em &gt;complicates this issue because Silentio is a character who claims not to understand faith. Perhaps it cannot be understood, because it’s positively singular, so Abraham’s faith is sui generis. Moreover, there aren’t a lot of other examples of faith in the book, so while we (with Silentio) are clearly supposed to find Abraham to be “great,” impressive, an inspiration, it’s unclear whether or how we’re supposed to try to emulate Abraham and live the religious life. Our ethical reading in &lt;em &gt;Either/O &lt;/em &gt;r was full of very direct advice, but this is just a description of faith as a phenomenon that Kierkegaard is arguing is much stranger than is suspected by his the bourgeois Protestants of his time who think that faith is just a simple matter of assenting to church doctrine.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Silentio says he does understand (and is presumably recommending to us as an attitude) the “knight of resignation” who has given up trying to control things. Being ethical involved taking up projects (the self being a central project), but how do you stay invested enough in projects such that they’re meaningful while not worrying about them. How do we not worry about our own deaths? Is the “posterity through the social” that the ethical promised enough for us? Being resigned to the possibility (or inevitability?) of misfortune is resignation: what Nietzsche called the love of fate (amour fati). Understanding this attitude is a step toward understanding faith, which not pessimistic resignation, but unwavering optimism that either everything is going to be all right. Abraham was confident that somehow he would get the lineage owed to him, and sure enough, his son was fine, but again, this outcome is not the point. He would have been laudably faithful even if God had ordered him to go ahead with the sacrifice, because ultimately, faith is about believing that God makes everything happen according to a wise plan, and that plan is always being fulfilled even if it makes no sense to Abraham or to us observing the situation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is this picture of faith something that you can understand or sympathize with? If not, is that just because there is something wrong with it, or merely because you lack faith (as Silentio claims he lacks it)? Since the “justification” for faith is entirely individual, Kierkegaard seems to have presented us with an unbridgeable epistemic gap. We cannot sympathize with the person of faith; we cannot see that person’s “reasons” for faith. Perhaps (per Kierkegaard’s reputation as proto-existentialist) there is no justification that can be cited for having faith, and a mere, unmotivated leap by the individual is required. But is faith something that each of us can just will? Silentio’s attitude (that he’s in awe of faith of this extreme sort but can’t get his head around it) suggests that we can’t, but the point is likely to leave the question to each reader.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691020266/kierkegaards-writings-vi-volume-6" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the Hong translation of the text that we used &lt;/a &gt;or you can &lt;a href="https://www.sorenkierkegaard.nl/artikelen/Engels/101.%20Fear%20and%20Trembling%20book%20Kierkegaard.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this other translation online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-29-on-self-11381010" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to our earlier discussion that touched on this book &lt;/a &gt;(though moreso &lt;em &gt;The Sickness Unto Death &lt;/em &gt;, another religious text written several years later).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Corey Mohler of &lt;a href="https://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Existential Comics &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This discussion concludes with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-333-fear-and-96076423?utm_medium=clipboard_copy &amp;amp;utm_source=copyLink &amp;amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator &amp;amp;utm_content=join_link"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan set ourselves as part of our ongoing Kierkegaard reading to re-listen to our 2010 &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-29-on-self-11381010"&gt;episode 29 &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;The Sickness Unto Death &lt;/em &gt;. This leads us to our personal histories regarding faith and how the idea of faith intersects with our philosophy studies.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does a thinker like Kierkegaard defy treatment via our format? Given that we cover typically one short work (whether essay or the beginning of a book) by an author, even with repeated revisits, do we ever get anything like a global picture of the thinker?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This year has tried more to take on that problem, with runs on not only Kierkegaard, but language, Chinese philosophy, German Romanticism, and we started off with Moore/Wittgenstein. We conclude by thinking about what sorts of runs we want to do next year. (OK, actually we conclude by talking about our health problems, but you can ignore that.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/95228484"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;first.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is this ideal self that Kierkegaard wants us to aim for, but yet which is within us as individuals already? How can each of us merge with the universal ethically yet assert our individuality? We talk more about what duty amounts to, how the ethicist might have a better view of beauty than the aesthete, plus we discuss K's theory of work and outline why he's so in favor of marriage. (Or are these really K's theories or just his narrator "the Judge" given that K himself famously abandoned his plans for marriage, and this essay was part of a lengthy literary effort to deal with that choice.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The "new work" episode Mark refers to is &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-83-new-work-w-27526118"&gt;#83 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're reading the second half of “The Balance Between the Esthetic and the Ethical in the Development of the Personality” from Vol. 2 of &lt;em &gt;Either/Or &lt;/em &gt;(1843). This is a direct continuation from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2023/12/10/ep331-1-kierkegaard-either-or-ethical-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 331 &lt;/a &gt;, which we felt gave us more than enough critique of the aesthetic life, but not enough of K's picture of the alternative, which is formation of a coherent self that is somehow affirmed "absolutely," both connecting us with God and yet also placing us firmly in time (unlike the Romantics, whose wish to merge with God places them supposedly outside of time). In practical terms, this means making real life commitments, including probably marriage, definitely friends, and certainly a job.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Given that I'm posting this on Christmas Eve, and I just watched a Christmas Carol, I'll venture that Scrooge's conversion might be exactly the kind of thing that Kierkegaard has in mind: Driven to see the emptiness of a small, personally directed life, Scrooge decides to make his business the welfare of the human race, to see himself not as self-interested but as someone whose life will only have meaning if it resounds beyond his own lifespan. What do you think?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our rather long Kierkegaard arc starts with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2023/11/10/ep329-1-kierkegaard-irony-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 329 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

In all of these stages, something else is posited as a locus of value or meaning for life than the person in question qua free agent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the first stage, this could be something like wealth, honor, or a loved one. These could all easily disappear, and Kierkegaard claims that someone at this stage is not merely in despair if this in fact happens, but is already in a state of despair just because of this dependence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second stage, you might place value in your own talents, but those are still things that can disappear and in that sense are external to you.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In stage three, you live for your own desires, thinking (erroneously) that if only you had unlimited resources, you could be happy. If the person actually gets these unlimited resources, a tyrant may result, like Nero.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the final stage, one realizes the futility of desire and so moderates desires like an Epicurean or Stoic. Yet this is still an unhealthy relationship to desire, and falls short of making the decisive ethical choice. Yet this last stage puts one in a good position to do this, and so we see in Volume 1's aesthete a great deal of reflection, including the realization that life is basically meaningless because the fulfillment of desire is never permanent and never actually fulfills us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also touch on the subsequent parts of the book about being "the unhappiest one" or a mystic, both of which are case studies in despair. Interestingly, even though you might thing a mystic would be OK in Kierkegaard's book, the Judge here describes the mystic as someone very much like a young lover who has placed the entire locus of value in the beloved. Waiting for the intermittent feeling of grace is just as pathetic as this; we must be able to find value and meaning in our personal and social life, not via some ascetic practice that shuns social norms and places all value in some obsession, however noble the object may be (e.g. your own artworks).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This concludes our treatment of Judge William's critique of aestheticism. In episode 332, we'll focus on Kierkegaard's positive recommendations for living that take up the rest of this lengthy essay. What sort of ethical move would assuage depression, make the self coherent, and give life meaning?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

As well discuss in episode 332, this requires that the ethical individual understand ethics as something internal (again, for Kant, ethics is a matter of self-legislation), not as a set of external rules that you're trying to conform to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kierkegaard describes the despair of the aesthete as a step that motivates the fundamental leap to becoming an ethical individual, and in part three of this discussion, we'll talk in more detail about the steps we outline here by which despair deepens and prepares us for transcendence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On “The Balance Between the Esthetic and the Ethical in the Development of the Personality” from Vol. 2 of Soren Kierkegaard's &lt;em &gt;Either/Or &lt;/em &gt;(1843).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is choice? While in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-330-either-or-93528237"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;, we covered the "Either," i.e. the Romantic, aesthetic way to live, this essay taking up much of the "Or" half of the book is presented as a lengthy letter sent to the author of that first half by an older, married man named Judge William. This essay was so long and great that we're discussing it over this episode as well as #332. In this half we largely get the negative part: William scolds the aesthete for not making any authentic choices, of instead just drifting aimlessly and whimsically. The primary, existential choice, according to the essay, is to choose freedom, i.e. to choose to make choices.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While the aesthete was in despair over the ultimate emptiness over the pleasures we tend to seek, the esthetic individual uses despair as a springboard to "choose himself absolutely," to make his own self into his life's task. This doesn't mean becoming narcissistic (which is the aesthete's problem), because this self must be concrete, nested in one's actual environment, with real relationships and work that aligns with duty.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691020426/kierkegaards-writings-iv-part-ii" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://ia803203.us.archive.org/13/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.188763/2015.188763.Either-Or-Vol-Ii_text.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Seth read through more of Kierkegaard's Diapsalmata, translated as "Refrains," which are the aphorisms that begin the book and demonstrate the aesthetic point of view. Start with parts &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-330-either-or-93528237"&gt;one &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-330-either-or-93528487"&gt;two &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here Kierkegaard (or rather his character "A") criticizes himself, gives advice for authors, analyzes laughter, talks about how to live with suffering in a debased age, and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Given that this is written as a character whom Kierkegaard is criticizing, shall we take any of this at face value, or is his real counsel the opposite of what we're reading here, or is the irony more subtle? The aesthetic point of view is a legitimate form of life, in that an intelligent person might spend a whole life in this stage; it is not limited to people who lack self-reflection, mental acuity, or good sense. So we should probably take these seriously as psychological observations. As we'll discuss in episode 331 when we read the ethical response to aestheticism, the aesthetic form of life is merely limited, not fulfilling human potential.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Knowing also that Kierkegaard himself is coming from a religious point of view that is one dialectical step beyond even the ethical, and that his view presumably in overcoming the ethical incorporates some of the energy and insight of the aesthetic point of view, perhaps we're supposed to take some of the insights here as legitimate criticisms of the ethical to be taken into account by Kierkegaard's synthesis.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-330-either-or-93528237"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "Diapsalmata" and "Rotation of Crops" from the "Either" portion of Kierkegaard's pseudonymous book ("either" being the aesthetic and "or" being the ethical, which we'll cover in ep. 331).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get a bit personal about this; to what extent is Seth criticizing our younger selves? (&lt;a href="https://marklint.bandcamp.com/track/all-too-familiar" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a song Mark wrote in 1990 &lt;/a &gt;in this vein.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk through more of K's aphorisms, considering whether K might actually agree with some of them, both when the anonymous author "A" critiques his own fellow Romantics, but also when he criticizes philosophy. In both cases, A thinks that people are living overly reflective lives, which makes them weak-willed.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The essay "Rotation of Crops" specifically talks about he scourge of boredom and how to rotate the pleasures in your life to keep things interesting enough to be bearable. Part of the advice in this patently hyperbolic (i.e. ironic on the part of the author A, in addition to the ironic distance between A and Kierkegaard) essay is to avoid marriage, friendships, and anything else that would force you into a boring routine. Clearly K thinks that there's something to this (he shunned marriage himself in favor the freedom to write), even though he's well known for advocating a type of Christianity that soundly rejects A's Romanticism even as it also argues for living passionately and actively.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the aphorisms ("Diapsalmata") that begin Soren Kierkegaard's Either/Or (1843), plus the essay also in the first volume, "Rotation of Crops." What is it to live your life as if it were a work of art? One might think (after having read the Romantics or Nietzsche) that this is the only honest way to live, that anything else (e.g. identifying yourself with a particular religion or cause) sacrifices your freedom and lies about who you are. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-141-beauvoirs-50859500"&gt;Beauvoir &lt;/a &gt;called this being "the serious man," and labeled it an existential error.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;K here explores this "aesthetic" way of being in the world from the inside, as a character known only in the text as "A," who sees the absurd in everyone else's pretensions and tries to live per the Romantic philosophy of K's time. So the first volume of &lt;em &gt;Either/Or &lt;/em &gt;is a collection of essays written by A that demonstrate the kinds of things that such a Romantic would value, criticize, and recommend. In the introductory set of aphorisms to this volume that we largely focused on, this climaxes in a section called "Either/Or: An Ecstatic Discourse," where whatever a person chooses will inevitably cause regret. True freedom comes in the moment before any choice at all is made, when the world is limitless possibility.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In line with K's criticism of Romanticism as described in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-329-on-irony-92663939"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;, K thinks this point of view is unserious and cowardly, and we'll read a direct response to this character in taking on the second half of the book for ep. 331. A is even pretty self-critical; he is aware that his whims do not bring him lasting happiness, and he complains about being bored and depressed, qualities which K thinks are a result of not being committed in a way that integrates your personality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're reading &lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691020419/kierkegaards-writing-iii-part-i" target="_blank"&gt;the Hong translation of the book &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/either-or-part-1-kierkegaards-writings_compress" target="_blank"&gt;Read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding our treatment (for the moment) of Book II of A Treatise of Human Nature (1739), this time reading section 7 "Of Vice and Virtue" within Part I, "Pride and Humility."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Pride is traditionally seen as a vice. Yet Hume has described it as a species of pleasure, and his overall ethical view takes pleasure to be the foundation of ethics; what we deem good are in general the things that make people feel good, the things that help us.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, and Dylan discuss &lt;em &gt;On the Concept of Irony, With Continual Reference to Socrates &lt;/em &gt;, Soren Kierkegaard's master's thesis (1841).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Rather than simply telling us what irony is, K spends the first half of his book talking about all the ways that Socrates might have been ironic: Not only is he mythologized by Plato (and parodied by Aristophanes and according to K's analysis misunderstood and rendered harmless by Xenophon), and his execution and subsequent veneration makes him an ironic hero of history, but chiefly his wholly negative activity of debunking the views of others without providing any positive replacement for these views is a chief characteristic of irony, according to K. (K considers the positive ideas in Plato like Forms and the cosmology to be all Plato, not Socrates.) Socrates' daemon, his (divine?) inner voice that motivates him to do philosophy , only ever tells him "no"; it doesn't direct but merely forbids.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second half of the book, K does give us a theory arising out of this analysis: Irony is not just sarcasm, which is saying the opposite of what you mean, but in a way that anyone who understand sarcasm is very clear about what you mean. Instead, it's about not taking a positive position. You say something, and you may be joking, or trying out a hypothesis, or even in earnest, but you're also inwardly saying (it's not necessary that the hearer knows you're speaking ironically) that you are not tied down by what you just said. You retain freedom.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;K thinks that this sort of freedom is an essential part of life, but it has to be properly contextualized. Asserting you're free of everything all the time is just irresponsible. You'd have no existential integrity: you're not actually defining &lt;em &gt;who you are &lt;/em &gt;. As one might expect given K's Christianity, he thinks what is great about Socratic irony is that it refers implicitly to an unknown beyond what's currently in front of you. Socrates criticizes a view (e.g. one of his opponents' takes on justice in &lt;em &gt;The Republic &lt;/em &gt;, like "justice is paying your debts"), because it fails to capture some higher ideal. Socrates doesn't know what that ideal amounts to, but he knows it's out there and is saying "no" to the here-and-now in its favor. Ironically, his statement "the only thing I know is that I know nothing" is not in itself ironic but a simply true statement when interpreted as "the only thing &lt;em &gt;of any real, philosophical importance &lt;/em &gt;that I know is that I know nothing."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/kierkegaard-soren-the-concept-of-irony" target="_blank"&gt;Read the book online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Corey Mohler of &lt;a href="https://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Existential Comics &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The discussion continues with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/92663946"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-329-on-irony-92663939?utm_medium=clipboard_copy &amp;amp;utm_source=copyLink &amp;amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator &amp;amp;utm_content=join_link"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;On the Concept of Irony,&lt;/em &gt;we finish up with Socrates and say why according to K, his type of irony is better than that of his Romantic peers like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-320-friedrich-85027020"&gt;Friedrich Schlegel &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The definition of irony that K finally gives us here is "infinite absolute negativity." Perhaps "global" would be a better word than "infinite," because the point is that it negates &lt;em &gt;all &lt;/em &gt;phenomena and is not just, e.g. a parody or rejection of some particular social practice or even a particular society. It's "absolute" because it negates the existent in favor of some unseen absolute (the divine). K describes the birth of irony in Socrates as the birth of subjectivity, as in the self-analysis and choice-making that distinguishes one person uniquely from everyone else. To be ironic is to not just let yourself be defined by others' expectations, but to have your own style of being.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;K distinguishes between an "inner infinity," where we each have infinite possibilities within us, which is good, and an "outer infinity," which is identifiable with nothingness. A Romantic builds on Fichte's idea that we as individuals create our entire world through interpretation: Out of the mass of perceptions I build my environment and myself, and by interpreting the world according to my wildly varying moods, I can in effect create different environments for myself to live in, different ways of being. While it would be dishonest ("bad faith" according to Sartre's later formulation) to nail myself down as being just &lt;em &gt;one &lt;/em &gt;type of person, the Romantic avoids any enduring self-definition at all and so ends up being nothing. Even though a Romantic is trying to realize oneness with God, this attempt to say see everything as underlyingly one is, according to K, nihilistic, because an undifferentiated everything (Spinoza's God) is indistinguishable from nothing (the Buddhist Void).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about examples like &lt;em &gt;The Colbert Report &lt;/em &gt;, Andy Kaufman, &lt;em &gt;Bob Roberts &lt;/em &gt;, and &lt;em &gt;Borat &lt;/em &gt;, &lt;em &gt;Spinal Tap &lt;/em &gt;, and more. &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/tag/irony/" target="_blank"&gt;Read Mark's past essays on this site about irony &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we talk about K's ethic of irony, and Mark and Wes will read through the last few pages of the book to lay this out more evidently. In short, the Romantic trying to live the poetic life ends up a slave to whims and moods, which is ironically exactly the opposite of the freedom that irony is supposed to provide. Also, K agrees with Nietzsche that one should not be a "despiser of life" in rejecting everything through irony. Rather, irony should give us the distance from the present circumstance to reconcile ourselves to it in a mature way, not to simply deny it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next time: &lt;/strong &gt;We'll hear more about Kierkegaard's critique of Romanticism as he does so "from the inside" by writing ironically as a character in the first essay in his next book, &lt;em &gt;Either/Or &lt;/em &gt;(1843). &lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691020419/kierkegaards-writing-iii-part-i" target="_blank"&gt;Buy it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan, and now Seth too discuss further Mounk's project in &lt;em &gt;The Identity Trap &lt;/em &gt;and what philosophically we can glean from it. Listen to parts &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-328-guest-one-91794964"&gt;one &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-328-guest-two-91840874"&gt;two &lt;/a &gt;of the interview first.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does the ideology that Mounk describes compare to, on the one hand, an ethical theory by an individual philosopher, and on the other hand, a scientific paradigm that provides a foundation for a group of researchers? Each of these types of epistemic structures involves some abstract principles that are supposed to guide action. A thinker trying to argue against such a structure may present some data that appears to be a counter-example to the theory, which in ethics is result that runs contrary to our moral intuitions, and in science is an experimental result that runs counter to the predictions of the scientific theory. In all these cases, there are then multiple ways that proponents of the paradigm can respond to the alleged counter-example: They can somehow deny the new data, or claim that it really doesn't make trouble for the theory, or can just alter some peripheral sub-claim within the paradigm/theory in response to the counter-example, or finally (and rarely) can abandon the paradigm/theory altogether.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;An ideology is perhaps the most difficult to deal with of the three types of epistemic structure, because its defense is spread out over more people with little agreement about who constitutes an authoritative voice in its defense. Mounk describes the identity synthesis as an ideology that has escaped the control and even the approval of its intellectual parents such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, who Mounk credits with pushing "intersectionality" to the forefront of our discourse but yet who barely recognizes its common use now as having anything to do with what she was arguing in the context of legal theory (that we need protections not just for people of color and for women, but to combat the discrimination experienced by someone with both of those traits).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the anecdote that opens Mounk's book, he describes how a black public school principal strongly urged a black parent that her child should be in "the black class." This example is supposed to be a reductio ad absurdum against the identity synthesis, showing that it implies the same objectionable segregation that the civil rights movement was designed to combat. Mounk warns against "too-farism," i.e. a reaction that admits that the principals action was improper, but falls short of condemning the identity synthesis itself. Perhaps the synthesis is sound, but this was just a bad application of it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We recap here the disparate theories the synthesis on Mounk's account involves and question whether these adequately represent the "woke" social movement that currently has so much influence in our academic institutions, media, and online culture. We are perhaps less interested in making political points in favor or in opposition to Mounk's polemic (you listeners can decide for yourselves to what extent he's captured the cultural moment and made legitimate criticisms against it) as figuring out what the epistemic standards are for arbitrating disputes about ideology. How can we decide if something is a legitimate cultural problem? How can we decide which formulation of the group's diverse beliefs to evaluate? How do we tell if and when a point has been scored against the ideology, and what do we do about that?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The underlying assumption is one that we've made early on and recurrently in the podcast: While individual philosophers make subtle and persuasive points in favor of many diverse worldviews (e.g. we aren't Christians but sure do respect St. Augustine among many others), by the time these theories get simplified and spread about a culture, the resultant ideology is of course going to be pretty stupid, and our current cultural religion, whatever it may be and however well intentioned its aims, is not going to be an exception to that. Derrick Bell, Herbert Marcuse, and Judith Butler were all brilliant, but the popular precepts that drive today's youth are only tangentially related to what those thinkers had to say, and we shouldn't be surprised if the resulting ideology drives some pretty foolish policy decisions and fuels a mob mentality whose power has more to do with the feeling of solidarity than it has to do with good philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;At the same time, we may have some appreciation for what Mounk is doing politically while disparaging his philosophical methods. The situation is comparable to our treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-44-new-of-15463063"&gt;The New Atheists &lt;/a &gt;: By arguing against a degraded, popularized philosophy instead of engaging the brilliant philosophers themselves, he's ceased to do something with very much philosophical interest. Arguing against a poorly formulated position does not require much philosophical acumen, and the critic can select the most evidently absurd examples of the ideology as easy targets. Mounk makes the decision between paradigms all too simple by characterizing it as boiling down to the question of whether our differences are more important than our similarities. Puzzlingly, he sees his tracing of the intellectual history of this identity synthesis as necessary, groundbreaking work, when a scholar in this area (such as Briana Toole, who &lt;a href="https://www.overthinkpodcast.com/episodes/episode-84" target="_blank"&gt;recently discussed standpoint epistemology on the Overthink podcast &lt;/a &gt;) would no doubt already be familiar with all of these ideas and be able to more accurately characterize how they fit together.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I should mention that the above write-up is more than usual expressing the preoccupations of only one of us (Mark), whereas the discussion itself, particularly in its second half, focuses on whether liberalism has the resources to gain justice for the powerless. A critic like Derrick Bell says no, whereas Mounk says yes. This is essentially the same argument that &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-157-richard-50993219"&gt;Rorty was making against James Baldwin &lt;/a &gt;: Despite the failures of America to live up to its ideals, we should not abandon its fundamental project.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Disappointed we weren't more direct and savage in dealing with this reading? Check out &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/167037/yascha-mounks-misguided-war-wokeness-great-experiment-review" target="_blank"&gt;this New Republic article on Mounk's previous book &lt;/a &gt;; most of the critiques here are still very on target.

In arguing against a "monomaniacal" prism for interpreting the world (whether via class as the Marxists use or via race, gender, and sexual orientation as is the case for identity theorists), Yascha's book seems to be championing common sense: Of course all of these things matter but need to be balanced against each other. Moreover, we should recognize that it's been liberalism that has allowed us to achieve the (imperfect) social progress that we have, and we should continue to try to live up to those values.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, in this part we challenge Yascha about the book's polemical character and his sweeping policy prescriptions. Should we base public policies on broad principles or pragmatically pursue whichever strategy (e.g. race-sensitive vs. race-neutral) seems to achieve the desired outcomes (e.g. educational outcomes) in the situation? Are selected anecdotes where a wrong choice was clearly made the best way to establish a general point about the rationale behind policy decisions?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yascha argues that while of course people should be free to pursue voluntary associations, the division of society into groups that do not fruitfully communicate and which see themselves in zero-competition is a recipe for social strife. So how do we ease these tensions and foster nation-wide solidarity while still respecting &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-85-rawls-on-w-30336771"&gt;Rawls &lt;/a &gt;' tenet of liberalism that says that that government needs to be neutral regarding the character of how people want to organize themselves? This represents an internal tension within liberalism: Liberalism, for example, requires free speech, but can illiberal speech erode the very norm that makes it possible? Does small-group solidarity of the sort that leads to isolation from the larger society likewise undermine the stability of that society that allows such freedom of association?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about diversity trainings, cultural association, free speech, deference to minorities, how inaccessible others' experiences are, and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-artists-be-allowed-to-borrow-from-cultures-besides-their-own/" target="_blank"&gt;Hear Yascha debate cultural appropriation with past PvI/PMP guest C.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Identity Trap &lt;/em &gt;(2023), Yascha's intellectual history wokeness (which he calls "the identity synthesis") and defense of philosophical liberalism against this set of ideas.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Which is more important, the characteristics that we all share as human beings, or those that make us part of distinct identity groups? According to Yascha's analysis, the ideology that currently dominates our academic institutions, media, and young people wrongly prioritizes the first of these. Whereas liberalism (in reaction to historical aristocracies and autocracies) has the ideal of treating everyone the same, the identity synthesis entails that we skew law and cultural advantages in favor of the oppressed, encouraging both oppressed groups to identify as members of their group and seek political solidarity with their fellow group members, and also encouraging the white majority to identify themselves not as merely human but as specifically white, so that they can then be aware of their privilege.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is this really an accurate characterization of wokeness? Is wokeness invariably illiberal, or is it meant to address the failings of an overly simplistic conception of liberalism? Mark, Wes, and Dylan attempt to explore these questions with our guest.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Unlike most of those arguing against wokeness, Yascha he is fully willing to admit to the injustices of the past and the structural racism of the present, but he argues that these do not justify illiberal measures such as segregation (e.g. legislating minority-only spaces), censorship (and cancellation of those deemed guilty of cultural appropriation, microaggressions, and the like), and policies that treat people differently according to their race or other group identifications (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-race-based-covid-treatment-white-hispanic-inequity-monoclonal-antibodies-antiviral-pfizer-omicron-11641573991" target="_blank"&gt;favoring young minorities over elderly whites in handing out COVID vaccines &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yascha is an intellectual historian, not a philosopher, and while he summarizes several philosophers, his primary interest is in seeing how their beliefs became over-simplified, made (often) more extreme, and disseminated. For instance, he characterizes Michel Foucault as pessimistic about grand narratives of progress: We may feel that we have all become more free as society has progressed, but the nature of power is such that any revolution contains the seeds of the next round of enslavement. The social order always polices itself, so society is invariably oppressive. This suspicion of the grand narrative of progress became simplified according to Yascha into a suspicion of the idea of objective truth. Moreover, while Foucault's pessimism translated to an apparent fatalism about the efficacy of political activity, those influenced by Foucault have ignored that aspect and have instead thought about what political actions make sense in a climate where no real progress is possible. The result is a view of politics that is zero-sum and thoroughly relativistic, with various groups merely fighting for their place in the hierarchy instead of people of all groups trying to progress together toward mutual freedom and benefit.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yascha also tells how thinkers like Derrick Bell that were suspicious of claims that civil rights legislation has successfully addressed racial disparities have influenced a generation that now believes that things are no better now for black people than they were generations ago, that racism is a permanent part of the human (or at least American) condition, and thus that supposed race-blind policies in fact just cement white power.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He characterizes the identity synthesis as adherence to seven fundamental claims:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;We should be very skeptical of anyone's claims to objective truth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discourse should be modified for political ends: Change words to change how people think.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Strategically emphasize racial and other differences even while admitting that these are ultimately socially constructed.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Be proudly pessimistic about claims that we have made social progress when it comes to equity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Distinguish people by identity group when designing legislation to avoid the continued oppression of historically oppressed groups.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Intersectionality (the fact that one can be oppressed via multiple dimensions in ways that are not simply additive, e.g. bell hooks argued that black women have suffered harms beyond those due to their blackness or their womanhood) dictates that to fight effectively against one type of oppression requires that we fight against all of them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Per "standpoint epistemology" (see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-293-donna-on-66167271"&gt;our Haraway episode &lt;/a &gt;), we can never really understand each other's points of view, and so those who are not members of oppressed groups should always defer in judgment to the marginalized when it comes to policies and attitudes about oppression.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whether or not one agrees with Yascha's characterization of woke ideology or his claim that classical liberalism provides an unproblematic alternative to this set of views, there are a lot of interesting concepts at play here, with the added challenge of connecting academic philosophy to the way that ideas infiltrate our culture and politics. We've considered many of the figures the book mentions in isolation without necessarily trying to synthesize them to decide what practical political philosophy we should have in light of their insights.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/712961/the-identity-trap-by-yascha-mounk/" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;, or you can &lt;a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/mounk2" target="_blank"&gt;listen to Yascha explain more about the book as he's interviewed by Coleman Hughes &lt;/a &gt;.

Pride, according to Hume, has both a cause (whatever you're proud of) and an object (the self). Hume describes this structure as both "natural" (as opposed to being a social construction) and "original" (based on an innate psychological capacity). Pride involves both impressions (e.g. you perceive that you find pleasure in whatever you're proud of), and ideas (e.g. you understand the relation of the thing we're proud of to yourself). For both of these types of mental entities, pride or any other emotion will also involve associated ideas and impressions; pride in something will make us think of other things, and feeling pride about a particular thing gives rise to related feelings, e.g. pride in those other things.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We switched which edition of the text we were reading since part one. &lt;a href="https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PHS414/David%20Hume_%20A%20Treatise%20of%20Human%20Nature_%20Volume%201_%20Texts.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;, starting on PDF p. 201.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 10/17/23. Mark, Wes, and eventually Seth get more into bullshit, considering G. A. Cohen's specifically anti-Continental philosophy response to Frankfurt to the effect that bullshit is a matter of qualities of the product, not of the speaker's state of mind. We compare bullshit with hypocrisy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This leads us to talk about Derrida, whom we're planning a future episode on, and why analytic philosophers might see writing in certain areas of philosophy as bullshitty. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jensensuther/status/1710771777930961141" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the little essay about Derrida and Joyce that Wes quotes from &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This leads to us talking about expressing things with the body (either through dance or being possessed a la &lt;em &gt;The Exorcist &lt;/em &gt;) that can't be expressed through words. Should philosophers watch horror movies?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we reflect on the fact that we've just interviewed two author guests (Michael Tomasello and Yascha Mounk, whose episode comes out soon) on the show (plus &lt;a href="https://philosophyimprov.com/pvi63-virtual-reality-david-chalmers/" target="_blank"&gt;Chalmers on PvI &lt;/a &gt;), which is unusual for us. Should we read "roadmap" sources that describe the state of literature in an area as opposed to just diving into primary sources? (This was one of the good parts about Mounk's book.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

How does David Hume deal with human emotions, given his empiricism that begins with the premise that our minds contain only impressions and ideas (which are mainly different from impressions in that they are fainter, like a memory of an apple as compared to the perception of an apple)?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/hume1739book2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Patreon supporters at the $10/month level will get additional parts to this discussion as they are released, plus the video for this discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Caring is a matter of identification: counting certain things or people as part of a circle of concern, essentially part of one's self. How and under what circumstances might we do this "wrong"? We discuss the extent to which this is a free act, bringing in Frankfurt's notion of freedom as acting in accordance with second order desires in his 1969 essay "&lt;a href="http://www.thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Readings/Frankfurt%20-%20Alternate%20Possibilities%20and%20Responsibility.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility &lt;/a &gt;."

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth discuss the celebrated 1986 essay "On Bullshit." (In part two, we'll cover by contrast his 1982 essay "The Importance of What We Care About.")&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is bullshit, or "humbug" as a previous essay by Max Black calls it? Frankfurt starts with Black's definition ("deceptive misrepresentation, short of lying, especially by pretentious word or deed, of somebody’s own thoughts, feelings, or attitudes") in order to define his own idea. While bullshit often involves lying, the point is not to lie, and much bullshit (e.g. a generic political speech) need not involve lies at all. Bullshit's distinguishing characteristic, according to Frankfurt, is its &lt;em &gt;indifference &lt;/em &gt;to the truth. We speak with some other purpose, such as impressing people, covering up the fact that you really have nothing to say, or paying "lip service" to some ideal to meet an audience expectation. Whether or not the particular sentences uttered for this purpose are true or not is beside the point.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There is deception involved in bullshit, but it's deception about the speaker's purpose: Hearers are supposed to think that the person is speaking honestly an authentically, but they're really being manipulated. This wrinkle introduces an exception for contexts in which the audience knows that they're being (for example) entertained or included in a ceremony or otherwise being spoken to in a context where honesty is not the point. Frankfurt gives the example of "bull sessions" where people speak casually to each other to explore ideas without committing themselves to actually believing or asserting them. In any instance of pretend or storytelling, hearers presumably know that they're not going to be told the literal truth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss how some public figures abuse this "play exception" to claim that they're not intending to make truth claims, as their point is instead to express solidarity with the audience, or to merely entertain. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/alex-joness-attorneys-defamation-suit-argue-no-reasonable-person-believe-says/" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Jones' lawyers argued &lt;/a &gt;that in defaming Sandy Hook victims, he was in effect playing a character, speaking in a forum where reasonable listeners would not take him to be speaking seriously. A similar claim &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/fact-checking-a-claim-that-fox-news/" target="_blank"&gt;was made by Fox News &lt;/a &gt;in defending itself against defamation, claiming that the statements in question were entertainment, not news. And of course Trump's defenders &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-do-none-of-trumps-jokes-feel-like-jokes/2020/07/03/bdcc053a-bca1-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;sometimes claim &lt;/a &gt;that he is using humor instead of lying. While Trump himself typically &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/23/trump-joking-slowing-coronavirus-testing-335459" target="_blank"&gt;denies this &lt;/a &gt;, this was certainly his defense of "&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/donald-trump-locker-room-talk-presidential-debate-2016-election/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;locker room talk &lt;/a &gt;" and is currently on display in his defense of his real estate valuations: These are about "&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/10/trump-fraud-trial-property-value-wealth/" target="_blank"&gt;brand development &lt;/a &gt;."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But of course, the hyperbole of marketing is exactly the kind of thing that Frankfurt had in mind when arguing against bullshit: The fact that we all know that advertisements, political speeches, organizational vision statements, bureaucratic ass-covering, and similar nonsense is less about truth than in achieving some practical purpose doesn't mean that such a disclaimer makes them morally unobjectionable. Much of our discourse, including this podcast, is in a grey area: Not prepared statements intended to to reliably impart truth, but some sort of language game designed to benefit the speakers (and hopefully hearers) in some way via a mix of truth, yes, but also opinions, hypotheses, musings, jokes, and other speech acts that surely partake to some extent in bullshit.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read the essay online &lt;/a &gt;. An interesting response that focuses more on the product bullshit instead of the speaker's purposes is &lt;a href="https://www.professorsapp.com/cohen--further-into-bullshi.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;G.A. Cohen's "Deeper Into Bullshit."&lt;/a &gt;Read Frankfurt's "&lt;a href="https://www.ceu.edu/sites/default/files/attachment/event/8682/frankfurt-importance-what-we-care-about.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Importance of What We Care About &lt;/a &gt;." You can watch Frankfurt himself discuss bullshit &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/W1RO93OS0Sk?si=D9DuGlWdLml_wfD2" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/hp_c8-CfZtg?si=aK7Te9I8nMJMSTNw" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://philosophyimprov.com/pvi61-team-play-adal-rifai-jenny-hansen/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to Mark's recent treatment of this same concept (with more exploration of its relation to play and irony) with Jenny Hansen and others on the Philosophy vs. Improv podcast &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Toward the end of Book VI and into Book VII of the &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;, Plato gives a series of metaphors for the role "the good itself" plays in our knowledge and values. We read here starting at line 507b of the G.M.A. Grube/C.D.C Reeve translation, where we hear that the form of the good is to  our ability to know anything as the sun is to our ability to see anything. We conclude by discussing the first half of Plato's "divided line" image, whose lower half marks off reflections/images and then the material objects that these are images of. Because these are in the lower half, we can't have any real knowledge of them; thus physical science should be impossible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Plato_Republic_Books_VI-VII_excerpt.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Follow along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Patreon supporters at the $10/month level will get additional parts to this discussion as they are released, plus the video for this discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes, Dylan, and guest Chris Heath continue to discuss &lt;em &gt;The Evolution of Agency &lt;/em &gt;(2022) in light of our interview with the author in part one.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We relate examples from the book of animals of various levels of complexity making deliberative decisions, exhibiting rationality, experiencing causality, or otherwise engaging in agentive or proto-agentive behaviors. One particularly interesting concept in here is the idea of collective social agency, where the feedback loops supporting complex action utilize multiple individuals, as when pack hunting animals, despite appearances, do not actually collaborate with each other but instead use each other to hunt more effectively as individuals.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're discussing Harry Frankfurt's "&lt;a href="https://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;On Bullshit &lt;/a &gt;" (1986) and "&lt;a href="https://www.ceu.edu/sites/default/files/attachment/event/8682/frankfurt-importance-what-we-care-about.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Importance of What We Care About &lt;/a &gt;" (1982).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;The psycho-linguist prof. from Duke University joins Wes, Dylan, Seth, and Chris Heath to discuss his 2022 book, &lt;em &gt;The Evolution of Agency: Behavioral Organization from Lizards to Humans.&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is human agency? How would we determine whether an animal is a legitimate agent, as opposed to just acting automatically? Tomasello investigates this by thinking about what capabilities and behaviors constitute agency and the degree to which near-human animals have these.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To be an agent, according to Tomasello, is to be able to self-regulate, to stop oneself from doing certain things, to make deliberate choices, to observe one's own behavior and potentially modify it. These capabilities require a feedback loop ("circular causation,"), and Tomasello observes simpler feedback loops in other mammals. For instance, a squirrel caching a nut has to look at the available terrain for digging, and so has some choice in where to put the nut, even though the behavior of nut caching is itself hard wired. In any environment with uncertainty, animals adapt to adjust to changing conditions like this, and the observation and modification of behavior that this involves is a precursor for human agency. In particular, the need for cooperation among members of the same species raises a challenge that only flexible creatures can meet. Tomasello argues that to reflect on one's own decision-making requires an "executive tier" of functioning, and he's interested in where that level of functioning came into the evolutionary story.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Tomasello's viewpoint is informed by philosophy, in that he's not just looking for forms of apparent reciprocity among animals, but is thinking about normativity itself, which is more abstract, and so (just as was the case for language, discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-323-acquiring-87940921"&gt;our ep. 323 &lt;/a &gt;) requires the imaginative ability to adopt another person's point of view and so create a "we" that combines the self and others. Moreover, agents have to have notions of causality and how their actions can affect others. Great apes are able to do this even though they don't have language, so while agency is related to the shared attentional abilities involved in language, the abilities in the two cases are not identical.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047005/the-evolution-of-agency/" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/tzC5HU_Cjbk?si=-rkWOMcz-PxVgIDT" target="_blank"&gt;Watch Michael give a presentation &lt;/a &gt;on the ideas from this book accompanied with a lot of visual aids.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Audio editing by &lt;a href="https://www.pixelboxmediagroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tyler Hislop &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-325-paul-on-89426489"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "Meaning" (1957), "Utterer’s Meaning and Intentions" (1969), and "Logic and Conversation" (1975) with guest &lt;a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/academic-programs/philosophy/faculty/employee_detail.dot?empId=02000322920013381 &amp;amp;pageTitle=Steve+Gimbel" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Gimbell &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We tie Grice's initial project about meaning into this apparently new project in "Logic and Conversation": What are the rules that people tend to follow in conversation to actually be engaged in the cooperative enterprise of exchanging meanings? Grice identifies this general framework that we follow as the "Cooperative Principle" and identifies several maxims within that: Providing the right amount of information in an utterance (not too much, not too little) for the context, providing high-quality conversational input (meaning not false, unsupported, or irrelevant), and speaking clearly. When a speaker appears to violate one of these principles, then there are systematic ways in which we as listeners try to interpret the speaker so as to still think of them as acting according to the Cooperative Principle. For instance, if someone says something blatantly false, we might look at it as irony or metaphor or some other non-literal speech. If someone provides too little information to be helpful, we might charitably think that the maxim to provide enough information was in conflict with the maxim to only provide high-quality information, which includes only information that the speaker has good evidence for, or perhaps the speaker has been sworn to secrecy or is otherwise trying to maintain decorum by not revealing private business.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We attempt to relate Grice's project to various activities in cognitive science (e.g. computer language modeling) and continental philosophy (e.g. the critique of writing from Plato through &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/05/07/ep189-authorial-intent-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Barthes &lt;/a &gt;). Some of these connections relate to whether Grice can unproblematically restrict himself to talking about what a speaker intentionally means as opposed to what meanings (natural meanings!) may be exhibited by a statement, whether this means the literary meanings that may be extracted from it beyond what the speaker meant, or the unconscious motives of the speaker who thus betrays certain meanings unintentionally through the utterance. Wes and Mark will delve into this issue further in the subsequent Closereads treatment of "Logic and Conversation" (a three-part conversation to be released over the next weeks, with the first installment of that to be made available to you PEL Citizens as PEL #325 part 3. Those of you that upgrade your Patreon support here to the $10/month level will get the other two parts plus video of all three.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;: We're interviewing Michael Tomasello about his new book, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047005/the-evolution-of-agency/" target="_blank"&gt;The Evolution of Agency &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Meaning" (1957), "Utterer’s Meaning and Intentions" (1969), and "Logic and Conversation" (1975), featuring Mark, Seth, Dylan, and guest prof. &lt;a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/academic-programs/philosophy/faculty/employee_detail.dot?empId=02000322920013381 &amp;amp;pageTitle=Steve+Gimbel" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Gimbell of Gettysburg College &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Someone who utters something typically means something in particular, but is that meaning determined just by the definitions of the words uttered? Clearly not, as words can be used in non-standard ways, and an "utterance," taking that word broadly, might not even include words at all, but gestures or noises, which can still be exhibited with intent. Grice was reacting to behaviorists and logical positivists who wanted to define meanings purely in terms of public properties of language, and he wanted to give a philosophically respectable account of meaning that acknowledges the psychology involved: That the speaker has some intention to communicate, which is some belief that the speaker wants to impart to the listener. Grice refers to this as "non-natural" meaning, as opposed to "natural" cases like "spots mean measels." Non-natural meanings are consciously held in people's minds as something they intend to communicate.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Grice considers numerous possible counter-examples to the theory as I've just stated it. For instance, if I leave a false clue at a murder scene, I may want a detective to have some belief (that someone in particular committed the murder), but that doesn't mean that the clue was a communication that had the intended meaning "X committed this murder." For something to be a communication, the hearer can't just receive the information, but has to understand that it was a communication, that I as the communicator had the intention to communicate that message.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our second article, "Utterer's Meaning and Intentions," considered many more potential counter-examples to defend the theory. For instance, if I yell at you in a language that you don't speak as you're walking on my lawn, but the literal words I'm saying mean "I love you," I clearly haven't communicated the sentiment that I love you despite my use of those words, but I may have successfully communicated that I want you to get off of my lawn. Grice considers highly layered examples: For instance, a man is playing poker against his boss. He wans to let his boss win, and he wants the boss to know that he's letting him win, but he doesn't want the boss to think that he (the first man) knows that the boss knows that he is letting the boss win. According to the theory, the man has the intention of both letting the boss win and letting the boss know that there's an effort to let him win, but this is still not a communication, as the boss is not supposed to think that his employee is trying to communicate the sentiment, "I'm letting you win." Yes, these examples can get confusing in their complexity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The third article goes into "conversational implicature," i.e. ways in which meanings are implied in idiosyncratic conversational gambits. Wes and Mark will actually read this paper in part three of this episode, continuing through two further parts as Closereads to finish the whole article.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We refer some to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-186-j-l-on-17643711"&gt;J.L. Austin &lt;/a &gt;, another so-called "ordinary language philosopher," and also &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-66-quine-on-17045937" target="_blank"&gt;Quine's argument &lt;/a &gt;against the real existence of synonymy, i.e. meaning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read the articles &lt;a href="https://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/f09/semprag1/grice57.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://williamstarr.net/teaching/speech_acts/Grice-1969-Utterers_Meaning%E2%80%93and_Intentions.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ls/studypacks/Grice-Logic.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes do a Closeread on the latter part of the dialogue, where Socrates argues to Cratylus that even if names (words) were devised to somehow depict the things they stand for, that wouldn't guarantee that they ACCURATELY describe the world. You can't look at the definitions of words to learn about the world; you have to actually investigate the world directly. &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Plato-Cratylus.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Follow along with us in the text &lt;/a &gt;, starting at the bottom of p. 144.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Folks in the $10/month tier can experience this as &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/88976022"&gt;video &lt;/a &gt;along with all the other Closereads content.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Start with parts &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-324-platos-on-88663358"&gt;one &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-324-platos-on-88663356"&gt;two &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/88663358"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on Plato's mid-period dialogue about language. Is attaching a word to a thing, i.e. naming it, like other activities such as carpentry or sewing that can go wrong? Can we put the "form" of a thing into letters and syllabus of its name? Socrates argues (at least through most of the dialogue) that we can, that some names can be more appropriate than others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this part, we get down to the hardcore etymology, relating Socrates' takes on Greek mythological names, ethical and metaphysical concepts, and more. We notably spend time on psuche (soul), phronesis vs. sophia (different kinds of wisdom), dikaiosune (justice), and techne (craft).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Take a look at &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-cratylus/" target="_blank"&gt;the Stanford Encyclopedia article &lt;/a &gt;that goes into more detail about different scholars' interpretations of this dialogue: Should we believe that Socrates is just joking? (Or even if he's not, does PLATO think that this activity is a joke?) For another long-form joke, you may or may not be aware of Mark's "&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Z6jyCM3bFV0?si=4SChgH_L1jaM1vD1" target="_blank"&gt;12 Interminable Days of Xmas &lt;/a &gt;."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There will be a part three to this episode where Mark and Wes Closeread the end of the dialogue &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Time &lt;/strong &gt;: We'll talk about two articles by Paul Grice, "&lt;a href="https://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/f07/pragmatics/grice57.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Meaning &lt;/a &gt;" (1957) and "&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2184179" target="_blank"&gt;Utterer's Meaning and Intention &lt;/a &gt;" (1969).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Plato's mid-period dialogue from around 388 BCE. How do words relate to the things they represent? Featuring Mark, Wes, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're all familiar with the feeling when we see someone really hot but with a very dweeby name that something seems to have gone wrong. We also know Native names like "Running Eagle" that may or may not seem to really fit the person with that name, and some people even have ironic nicknames, like a huge guy named "Tiny." This is the sort of phenomenon that this dialogue deals with, though Socrates and his pals Hermogenes and Cratylus quickly get past proper names to talk about concept words like justice, wisdom, being, and judgment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;They start with the question as to whether the words chosen to represent concepts are merely conventional, meaning that really any word could just as well be used for any purpose, or whether words are meant to in some way describe their concepts. If they accurately describe concepts, i.e. real phenomena in the world, then talking about the meanings of words should be a good way to learn about the world: a good way of doing philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To prove to Hermogenes that words are not merely conventional, Socrates first describes naming (assigning a word to a concept) as an activity like the construction of a tool for cutting. Clearly some saws and axes can be well made, and others can be poorly made, and this is not just a matter of opinion, but a matter of how well they do the job of cutting. So what is the job of words? To cut the world into pieces for us to think about (to "divide being")! Socrates then spends a long time looking at the etymology of various Greek words to say that, for instance, the word "human" (in Greek "antrhopoi") puts for a theory about what human beings are, because the Greek word is just a compressed evolution of "anathron ha opope," which literally means "one who observes closely what he has seen."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Apparently lots of intellectuals did this kind of thing, and a twist late in the dialogue has left scholars wondering whether the whole exercise might not have been some kind of joke. After demonstrating to Hermogenes that many words refer to movement and flow, and theorizing that these original word-makers had a correspondingly &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-79-heraclitus-27507479"&gt;Heraclitan &lt;/a &gt;view of nature whereby everything is always in motion, Socrates then switches to argue with Cratylus (who had come in with this idea that names are not merely conventional, but is silent for the first 3/4 of the dialogue) that first, one can give etymologies just as well that depict the universe as mostly stable (not in motion), second, that etymology is not a useful way to actually achieve insights about the concepts that words are about (they're only as good as the theories of the original word-makers), and third, that the Heraclitan view of nature is absurd, since we wouldn't even be able to coherently talk about things if they were always changing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So probably Plato didn't ultimately believe that words are descriptions of things (much less the parts of word, where individual sounds refer to flow or stoppage according to whether air is stopped as we utter them), but he sure does spend a lot of time on them in this dialogue. He certainly seems to find it an interesting exercise to use etymologies to think about how we intuitively view things in the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This whole issue certainly seems archaic, and so Plato's take on language here is not as central to the philosophy of language as his takes on ethics or knowledge. But the idea of an ideal language where every element perfectly matches the thing it represents is one that came back in the early 20th century among logicians like Russell, Wittgenstein, and the logical positivists who saw the ambiguities in language as having caused most philosophical problems. A perfectly logical language would make the relations between philosophical claims completely transparent, and it would do this by ensuring that every symbol had exactly one, unambiguous meaning, and that complex symbols could be decomposed into simple symbols which would be rooted to (on some accounts) atomic perceptions (like "red dot appearance at location XYZ").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Similarly, Socrates describes a language where complex Greek words can be definitively traced to being combinations of simpler words, and these basic words gain their resemblance to things in the world via the character of their component sounds. With such a system, it's not just whole sentences that be true or false (e.g. "the cat is on the mat"), but individual words ("cat" is true if and only if that word accurately reflects the essence of cats) and even sounds (the hard "c" sound is appropriate in "cat" if and only if the essence of cat involves some sort of harshness naturally connoted by that harsh, cutting sound). Of course, language doesn't and couldn't work that way, but if one imagines like Plato that the language we actually use, like everything else in our imperfect sensory universe, is just a pale imitation of some perfect version in the realm of the forms, then perhaps this could be an ideal toward which regular language does and should strive. Even though language will never attain this, it provides a standard for judging the words we do have, and etymology (as many philosophers since including notably Heidegger and Leo Strauss) can be useful in teasing out our philosophical intuitions and the history of ideas.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the other side, we can wonder with Hermogenes how "conventional" language can be. As Hermogenes initially argues, we can not only as communities but as individuals just call any concept by any word we want, and as long as we know what we mean, then that's a legitimate name for that thing. This is arguably how language evolves: One person calls something out in a new way, it catches on within a small community, and then this spreads. We spend some time talking about how this might relate to Wittgenstein's private language argument, which is more focused on my "naming" my private mental states than on my quirkily using the word "horse" to refer to what other people mean by "human," which is the sort of example that Hermogenes and Socrates discuss.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://hackettpublishing.com/philosophy/philosophy-mind-language/cratylus" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the C.D.C.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 8/21/23. Mark, Seth, Dylan, and eventually Wes catch up, getting into people's travels, getting in touch with nature, &lt;em &gt;Barbie &lt;/em &gt;, &lt;em &gt;How To with John Wilson &lt;/em &gt;, anticipating our upcoming episodes, and then a large information dump from Wes about his research into gender and evolutionary psychology, which will no doubt end up in a PEL episode eventually.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude by discussing the image of the mind assumed by cognitive science and how Tomasello seems to be arguing against this. The critique is made explicit in an article that we looked at: "&lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer" target="_blank"&gt;The Empty Brain: Your Brain Does Not Process Information, Retrieve Knowledge, or Store Memories.

With guest Christopher Heath.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get into more of the insights and studies that drove Chomsky and Pinker to argue that language is largely innate and how Tomasello rebuts or gives an alternative interpretation of the data. For instance, Chomsky stressed the recursive, logical nature of grammar: clauses can be nested inside each other in a sentence indefinitely. Tomasello stresses that this kind of complexity actually doesn't jump into existence in children early, and it can be explained well enough by cognitive abilities that are not specific to language.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Given the variety of languages, some of which (like English) use a grammar based on word order, and some of which instead build numerous suffixes onto words that indicate grammar, Tomasello claims that there's no reason to think that there's a universal grammar that we're all born with that then has to be instantiated in these vastly different ways. In the fact of this variety, Chomsky proposed instead of an actual grammar a set of grammatical parameters, as if the particular language just has to flip a switch to enact a module that instantiates grammar via word order or suffixes. So it's possible to extend Chomsky's paradigm with added features like this, but is it worth doing so? Tomasello explains the universals we do see (e.g. the presence of nouns and verbs in all languages) as a result of common strategies for figuring out the world (it makes a lot of survival sense to break down the world into actions and objects).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading Plato's &lt;em &gt;Cratylus &lt;/em &gt;, also about language, specifically the C.D.C. Reade translation, which you can see in John M.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Michael Tomasello's "Language Is Not an Instinct" (1995) and ch. 1, 2, 8 and 9 of &lt;em &gt;Constructing a Language: A Usage-Based Theory of Language Acquisition &lt;/em &gt;(2003), plus the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article &lt;em &gt;Innateness and Language &lt;/em &gt;by Fiona Cowie (posted 2008, updated 2017). Featuring Mark, Wes, Seth, Dylan, and guest Christopher Heath.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Clearly we are not born knowing language, and clearly we are (mostly?) unique among animals in being able to acquire it. But what exactly is inborn or instinctual about language?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Noam Chomsky argued starting in 1957 that while of course, we learn vocabulary and specific syntax (grammar rules) from our parents, we come equipped with an underlying "universal grammar" that's just waiting to be filled in by these particulars. He pointed to a "poverty of the stimulus," which refers to the sentences that we actually hear as children, vs. the novelty that children are quickly capable of delivering. Just as Plato pointed out in the &lt;em &gt;Meno &lt;/em &gt;that we all can recognize geometrical truths and even do some basic geometry having only been shown such basic tasks as how to draw shapes with a stick in the dirt, Chomsky claimed that we're born having done a great deal of work involved in learning a language, such that no one actually has to teach us; just speaking in the presence of a child is enough for them to learn.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Tomasello disagreed with Chomsky's claim that "you can't get there from here," i.e. that the utterances that children hear are not rich enough to explain their ability to talk innovatively using complex sentence structures. Instead, Tomasello pointed to the ability of children as of around the end of their first year to understand that other people have a distinct point of view from theirs. This is called "theory of mind," which we previously explored on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-172-mind-self-52103495"&gt;ep. 172 with Dr. Drew &lt;/a &gt;. While animals and pre-linguistic children may be able to use signs designed to produce behavior in others, they can't use symbols that indicate absent things. They can't just try to draw your attention to something without trying to get you to do something about that thing (so of course a dog can "try to get your attention" for affection or food or whatever, but it can't indicate "hey, look at that thing there; that's weird!). Tomasello thought that this general capability we acquire to put ourselves in others' shoes is sufficient to explain children's rapid growth in linguistic ability.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another related episode is &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-290-susanne-64300111"&gt;our series on Suzanne Langer on symbolism &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://danielwharris.com/teaching/268/readings/Tomasello.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Tomasello's article online &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674017641" target="_blank"&gt;Buy Constructing a Language &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-language/" target="_blank"&gt;Read the Stanford article &lt;/a &gt;that describes the debate in detail, including Skinner's position that Chomsky was reacting to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The most popular contemporary writer espousing the view inherited from Chomsky is Steven Pinker, and the book that Tomasello's article is actually reviewing is &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_Instinct" target="_blank"&gt;The Language Instinct &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1994).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why did we not actually read some Chomsky? This was on Chris' recommendation; I believe because Chomsky is too boring and esoteric: more hardcore linguistics and less philosophy. But perhaps you listeners that have read a lot of him could recommend something that would be suitable for a Closereads episode?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are we underlyingly all really a single, unified organism? Or do we just have a lot in common? We begin unraveling this puzzling claim by reading Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1841 essay "The Over-Soul." &lt;a href="https://emersoncentral.com/texts/essays-first-series/the-over-soul/" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/87673209"&gt;Watch the video &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is the first of four parts of this series. The others will all be up this week, but will only be visible to those who have upgraded their support level here to $10/month. Doing this will add all future Closereads audio to your Patreon podcast feed and allow you to watch ad-free videos right here on Patreon. We estimate we'll record one of these per week going forward, but would like to do them even more often than that if we have enough support to warrant doing so.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Just to ensure you, this new series is not in any way replacing PEL; it's just an additional thing that Mark and Wes are doing that folks can optionally pay extra to experience. (And we do plan on making some or all of the part 1's in this series available to the $5 folks going forward.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Enrollment has now opened for Mark's Core Philosophy Texts class.

I will assume not unless you tell me otherwise.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As the introduction says, this three-part Hegel on Spinoza series is your introductory dose. But this is really a separate project from PEL, and so while we're planning to make future part 1's available to you $5 PEL Citizen-types here, we're planning in most cases to reserve future part 2's of this sort to the $10 tier here, and if you'd rather have a Closereads-specific feed for some reason, we're creating a new Patreon page just for this new podcast.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Unlike our other network podcasts, this will remain fundamentally a supporter-only deal. We're not planning right now to have a public feed, though I suppose if it's hugely popular, we might change our mind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Closereads: Philosophy with Mark and Wes, where we read through and talk about a text line by line.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Today we're starting the entry on Spinoza from Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Lectures on the History of Philosophy &lt;/em &gt;(1830). &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Hegel-lectures-history-of-philosophy-spinoza.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read along with us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But you don't have to just listen: This is a video podcast... not that you have to watch the video, but maybe you'd like to. Let us know if you like the new format (which is not replacing PEL, but is a thing we're doing in addition to it) and if there are any texts in particular you'd recommend that we take on. Due to the nature of the format, they either have to be pretty short, which could mean (as in this case) a small piece of a longer text.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/SgeL4xCizOg" target="_blank"&gt;WATCH THE VIDEO &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes conclude with some close reading of Part 6 of &lt;em &gt;System of Transcendental Idealism &lt;/em &gt;(1800), section 3: "Relation of Art to Philosophy."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What exactly is self-consciousness, and how to we achieve it? We try to really figure out Schelling's story about art in light of his general picture of the function of philosophy as revelatory of the self. Why should that even be the goal of philosophy? For Fichte, the self literally creates everything, but Schelling (and Hegel following him) broke from Fichte in positing that there must be some other ground for the objective, foreign from the self, that then provides the material for us to then reflect back on ourselves. Maybe it's other people. Maybe it's things that you work on, which then provide objective material for you to reflect on. And maybe, specifically, it's art, that (if done well) creates an external representation of your own (universal) feelings and insights so that you can then understand yourself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading some things on the origin of language, starting with &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-language/" target="_blank"&gt;the Stanford Encyclopedia article on the innateness of language &lt;/a &gt;, then two works by Michael Tomasello: &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674017641" target="_blank"&gt;Constructing a Language: A Usage-Based Theory of Language Acquisition &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(Ch. 1-3, 8-9) and “&lt;a href="https://danielwharris.com/teaching/268/readings/Tomasello.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Language is Not an Instinct &lt;/a &gt;" (1995).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing (sans Seth) from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/86488918"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "On the Relation Between the Plastic Arts and Nature" (1807) and Part 6 of &lt;em &gt;System of Transcendental Idealism &lt;/em &gt;(1800).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We finish up the 1807 speech by talking about sculpture vs. painting and then move on to this penultimate chapter of this early, systematic, seminal work whose beginning we treated in episodes &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-273-friedrich-53324574"&gt;273 &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-274-schelling-53831010"&gt;274 &lt;/a &gt;. The &lt;em &gt;System of Transcendental Idealism &lt;/em &gt;served as the rough blueprint for Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;, and so it begins with basic perception and self-consciousness, moves through philosophy of science, ethics, and history, and we're now reading this part because somehow the whole philosophical project culminates in art, in a very dense, 15-page section that provides the theoretical basis for the much more listener-friendly 1807 speech (and arguably for most of what the Schlegel brothers had to tell us in our last two episodes).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The key idea here is that art allows us to somehow immediately, intuitively grasp infinity, which is what philosophy is trying to understand but can never fully and explicitly do so via conceptual reasoning. The point of philosophy is also to fully realize self-consciousness, where this means not the bare, empty introspection that anyone can do at any time, but the "thick" self-consciousness where you as an individual realize that you are (per transcendental idealism) in some sense identical to the whole universe.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There are two parts to this (that are made clearer in our prior episodes on Fichte and Schelling): The idealist position is that we create all that we experience with our minds. So even though the objective world looks quite different than me, the person who's perceiving it, understanding the truth of idealism means claiming responsibility for all that objective stuff, understanding that I'm constructing it, and so in that sense it's actually part of me. But these idealists are not relativists or (worse) solipsists: They don't literally mean that each of us as a unique individual creates our own world, or that only the philosopher is real. Instead, the self that is doing the creating ends up being not you as a free individual, but you as one somehow individuated perspective within the group mind that is really God. We're all designed similarly, according to the same blueprint, to create the world in a similar kind of way; this is what makes the idealism "transcendental," in that I as an instantiation of this ultimate creative force am not something that I experience in the same way that I experience the objects of my perception.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So how do we experience ourselves in this way? Again, art is the only way to really grasp this, because the truths of art strike us as eternal truths. When a mood or a face or a figure or a situation is captured with grace and perfection, we experience that as timeless and hence infinite: Something that we could really sink into and contemplate pretty much indefinitely without getting bored.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling's "On the Relation Between the Plastic Arts and Nature" (1807) and Part 6 of &lt;em &gt;System of Transcendental Idealism &lt;/em &gt;(1800), featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is the goal of art to imitate nature? Schelling says "sort of." It's not supposed to just be a copy, but is supposed to convey the true inner nature of its subject: It copies nature as nature is striving to be, whether this means the ideally beautiful version of a thing, or just an evocation of the striving itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Art is not just about capturing beautiful forms; if this was the case, then artists could just copy directly from the ancients. Good art needs not just elements in spatial arrangements but a unifying idea that really captures the essence of the thing. Figuring out essences is also what philosophy (and "effective science") tries to do, only art enables us to do this intuitively, while philosophy is necessarily discursive. Schelling describes the presence of this essence as "grace," which (probably) means both gracefulness (indicating that the form and essence are in sync) and God's grace (since the essence is the inner, divine part of everything).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As this is still German Romanticism, we get some comments on the role of passion in creating art. It's not that artists are supposed to tame their passion via their craft, but that these things are supposed to be merged. The beauty of forms depicted and hence the truths about the subject matter are what keeps the passionate artist from merely screaming and creating a bunch of energetic, random nonsense.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The article was a speech given during a royal event that featured sculptures, and so Schelling is concerned with the way this is done in sculpture and why ancient Greece was particularly well suited for creating them (e.g. because of their mythology that encouraged them to draw godlike human forms), while painting is better suited to modern sensibilities, with its ability to represent wider vistas in unique ways.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophyartan00schegoog/page/n10/mode/2up" target="_blank"&gt;the version of the essay that we read &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://journals.library.mun.ca/index.php/kabiri/article/view/2418" target="_blank"&gt;this newer translation &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 7/9/23. For the first time, we're presenting the &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/live/msxuS6c1rUE" target="_blank"&gt;unedited version of this to all you supporters on video &lt;/a &gt;, if you'd prefer to watch us than listen.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Seth trade a few tech-gone-wrong stories and give a preliminary response to a request that we cover some philosophy of technology on the show. We've already done plenty of philosophy of mind that covers whether computers think, have talked about how dehumanizing modernity is, and given critiques of media, but there's probably more good stuff that's being discussed right now by philosophers that we don't know about, so please let us know what great things you're running into that we should probably talk about. Listen to the Not School recording on Heidegger on tech.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We generalize this to talk about how much practical ethics we should do, e.g. business ethics, medical ethics, or environmental ethics. Are most of these just matters of choosing the most effective policies, or are there really disagreements about moral principles involved in these areas? Again, we don't really know.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We anticipate our upcoming Schelling episode as a case study of whether we remember past episodes (i.e. when we previously covered Schelling), and maybe Mark will write a dissertation, but probably not. What summer films are we looking forward to? For some reason we talk weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark stretches this out by giving his little book report on David Foster Wallace's &lt;em &gt;Infinite Jest &lt;/em &gt;. Do difficult books work better as audiobooks?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/85798632"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on our excerpt from &lt;em &gt;Theory of Art &lt;/em &gt;(ca. 1800), we get more into the text, covering Schlegel's critique of various elements of Kant's philosophy of art.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start with the distinction between free and accessory beauty: Are there some perceptions of beauty that are entirely divorced from a notion of the purpose or type of thing that we're perceiving as beautiful? Schlegel says no; we always read meaning and purpose into things, and this is necessary for us to find them as beautiful.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also, what is genius? If it's pure inspiration, then it's essentially nature acting through artists. Schlegel thinks the best art fuses conscious craft with unconscious inspiration, and this harmonic fusion of the animal and divine is the goal of art-making. Relatedly, Schlegel distinguishes between "manner," which is personal idiosyncrasies that interfere with achieving this goal, and "style," which amounts to a discovery of a new way to achieve such fusion. The genius work created in this way also gets at (and really establishes) an ideal. Art does not so much imitate nature as we see it (e.g. the most beautiful face is not a mere average of the faces we've experienced) as prescriptively say what nature should be like, with the caveat that Schlegel sees nature as dynamic and so already containing implicit goals (ideas, telos) that natural systems (like faces) seem to be shooting for.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We'll finalize our treatment of German Romanticism by revising Friedrich Schelling, first reading the final sections about art from his System of Transcendental Idealism (1800), and then reading a later essay, "&lt;a href="https://journals.library.mun.ca/index.php/kabiri/article/viewFile/2418/1937" target="_blank"&gt;On the Relation Between the Plastic Arts and Nature &lt;/a &gt;" from (1807).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Covering the elder Schlegel brother's &lt;em &gt;Theory of Art &lt;/em &gt;(ca. 1800), as excerpted in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/theory-as-practice" target="_blank"&gt;Theory as Practice: A Critical Anthology of Early German Romantic Writings &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;August Wilhelm Schlegel was five years older than &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-320-friedrich-85027020"&gt;Friedrich &lt;/a &gt;, and was also a well known art critic of his time. This text is a Romantic response to Kant's &lt;em &gt;Third Critique &lt;/em &gt;, and we looked back at &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/close-reading-of-50227242"&gt;Kant's comments on the sublime &lt;/a &gt;to help us prepare. A.W. Schlegel thought that our appreciation for Beauty has to do with our relationship with infinity, whereas for Kant, that's only a factor when we confront the awesome power of the sublime.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Kant, all we can legitimately apply pure reason to is the world of our experience, even though we can apply practical reason to ethical and theological matters (and so be justified in believing in God and prescribing ethical laws even though we can't prove these matters). The Romantics likewise weren't interested in proving things about the Absolute (God, the primordial unity of everything), but they wanted to argue that our feelings open us up to this, and that art is able to tread where pure reason (philosophy) cannot in achieving this fundamentally religious goal. Schlegel saw a hint in Kant's theory of the sublime, which is an experience where we react to something vast and and awesome. However, Kant thought that this was fundamentally different than our experience of Beauty, where we appreciate a finite form, like the shape of a beautiful face, a geometric shape, or the patterns of sound in a Bach etude.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Both cases do involve Kant's classic "disinterest," in that for beauty, we're appreciate the abstract forms and are not wanting to, e.g. sensually caress that beautiful face, and even for the sublime, we're not actually scared by the vastness, because we're able as artistic spectators to put a certain distance between us and the sublime object, whether this be a mighty storm depicted on film, or a huge piece of architecture or sculpture, or more metaphorically, the awesome power of fate that we see in the tragedies of Sophocles, battering around the lives of the characters. But even Kant admits that the beautiful carries with it a feeling of life's being furthered, so it's not just a cold appreciation totally divorced from our moral impulses.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Schlegel, the beautiful and the sublime are just different flavors of the same kind of experience: Art symbolically reveals the inner lives of things: their true nature as underlyingly One. Through drama, we depict the dynamics of our mental lives in ways that other people identify, because they feel similarly. These dynamics aren't just characteristic of humans, but (Schlegel thought) are common to nature itself, properly understood not as cold, blind mechanism but as spiritual and responsive.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

How can having some sort of common mythology help artists be original in this way, and how can we embrace mythology as modern people?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We try to figure out this "Speech on Mythology" by a character named Ludoviko in Schlegel's dialogue: The mythology is supposed to have something to do with the Transcendental Idealism of Fichte and Schelling, how these systems create reality out of the mind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk more about irony and its uses in art and connections to philosophy (and mythology).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In Part 3, Mark and Wes will spend more time with Schlegel's fragments.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On selected fragments from 1797-1801, "Dialogue on Poesy" (1799), and "Concerning the Essence of Critique" (1804).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes art "Romantic"? Friedrich Schlegel (and his older brother August Schlegel, whom we'll read for ep. 321) were both art critics based in Jena, Germany, which was also where Fichte, Schelling, Schiller, and even Goethe were based at the time. The Schlegels and their poet-pal Novalis ran a couple of magazines where they published their fragments (aphorisms), including the famous &lt;em &gt;Athenaum &lt;/em &gt;116 that lays out what "romantic poesy" is (poesy meaning artistic creation in general, not just poetry, though that's certainly the chief case he has in mind): Poesy must be universal and progressive. The underlying metaphysics here is roughly Spinozan or transcendentalist: Underneath our individuality we are in some sense literally all one being, and art is about channeling that underlying unity, but (paradoxically) doing it in a very individual way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In his &lt;em &gt;Dialogue on Poesy &lt;/em &gt;(which is structured much like Plato's &lt;em &gt;Symposium &lt;/em &gt;, with many speakers giving different views surrounding art and beauty), Schlegel posits that we (meaning his fellow German artists) need a modern analogue of what mythology was to the ancient Greeks. Mythology was something that all the classical playwrights and storytellers and sculptors could reference freely as the symbol of something transcendent. Much like Nietzsche did later in his &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-119-nietzsche-50275914"&gt;Birth of Tragedy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;and other works, Schlegel had high regard for these ancients, but thought we could do better, because their virtue was based on instinct, whereas the modern spirit is reflective. Like Schiller, Schlegel mourned that with Enlightenment science, the intellectual climate had become too mechanized, too much based on rules and reason as against instinct, and so we need to rediscover what made the instinct of the Greeks result in so much great art and progressively forge a new version of that, but based on freedom instead of the blind determinism of instinct.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Schlegel doesn't really tell us what this "new mythology" would look like or how we can build it, but the goal is definitely a "bildung" (some cultural edifice he wants the Romantics as a group to build), and it's necessary that this be a group effort, not the task of one philosophy sitting down and giving us a grand, complete system a la Kant, Fichte, or Schelling. Instead, Schlegel takes himself to be building off of Fichte's idealist insight that each of our minds builds its own world, combined with this ancient idea most prominently (for these philosophers) popularized by Spinoza that all of reality is really just one giant mind (which one could call God, though it's not necessarily a Christian personal God). So each of us as an artist, if we're not just emptily obeying some formal rules about what we think art is supposed to be or just producing random garbage (Schlegel considered &lt;em &gt;most &lt;/em &gt;art to fall into one of these categories), is imaginatively creating a world, but in doing so is channeling and aiming at something universal. Romantic art recognizes this very peculiar situation and so may make heavy use of irony, genre conventions, and other tools that make art not merely an expression of a private emotion (which might be what you'd think Romanticism amounts to), but an artful reflection on the human condition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Creating art thus ends up being the same as doing philosophy, or rather the two are aiming at the same goal, which is realizing the true nature of the self as God (or as Spinoza puts it, individuals are "modes" of God). In effect, Romanticism is a type of mysticism, but it's not mystical in the sense of trying to blur together all distinctions, because as a critic, Schlegel was very demanding: All creative acts may stem from the same divine source, but they're not all equally successful, in that that some of them capture the profound truths about this source, and most don't.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, Schlegel was also careful not to impose predetermined rules or limits on an artist's work. He was against "poetics," which would be using philosophy to come up with rules for what makes something beautiful or otherwise artistically effective and then using those rules to educate artists about the "right" ways to do art. If genius artists are in effect channeling God when they create, then sure, we want to study them to help point out what's so great about them to other people who might not be able to recognize this great art, but we don't want to take the internal laws of an artwork as prescriptions to judge other artworks that may have been constructed on a wholly different (though still divinely inspired) plan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Browse Schlegel's fragments &lt;a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Schlegel_Philosophical_Fragments_UMP_edition.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;online &lt;/a &gt;(#116 is on p. 31, i.e. PDF p. 61).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;In our final word on Friedrich Schiller's &lt;em &gt;On the Aesthetic Education of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1795), we cover letters 24-27 in more detail than we had time for in supposedly finishing with this reading in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-319-schiller-84338091"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Schiller talks first about hypothetical Reason, where Reason doesn't actually pull us toward Kantian morality, but just lets us get what we want more effectively. By granting us this, Reason can actually lead us increase our demands to fulfill our irrational, immoral needs (Schiller uses the term "absolute need").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is a Kantian critique of any non-Kantian ethical system, whether utilitarianism or virtue ethics: Any seeking explicitly after the good life for yourself or even for the whole society is not sufficiently divine or Reasonable or self-legislated for Kant and Schiller. We natural use Reason first and foremost to look for explanations of things in the empirical world, e.g. via science, or the human sciences including potentially some kind of scientific ethics, some kind of way to socially engineer people. This look like what Schiller is doing in this very treatise, in that he's recommending a system of education and practice that will make people better, but what underlies that is the attraction of Reason itself as Kant thinks of it, which is not just a matter of looking at people's actual behavior and trying to come up with some system to make them better. What's essential about people (for Schiller, and Kant, although Kant avoids religious language for the most part when talking about morality) is that they're souls: Absolutely free spirits who dwell (until their consciousness is filled with perceptual content) as unchanging, eternal, transcendental egos.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Per Romanticism (following Spinoza and others), insofar as we are acting in this pre-personal, spiritual way, we are literally one and the same being. Comparably, if we each think hard entirely about the Pythagorean theorem, not about the history of its discovery of Pythagoras' name, but about the mathematical fact itself, then we're all not just different minds thinking the same thing, but literally the same mind. This kind of thinking is what's at the root of Schiller's claim that art brings us together. It's not just that I make you some art that makes you feel good, and you do likewise, and so we're all happy making things for each other, but that art enables mystical unity, like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-102-emerson-33200505"&gt;Emerson's Oversoul &lt;/a &gt;. This is ultimately why appreciating Beauty makes us good citizens. Insofar as we turn away from our private sensations and desires towards universal truths of Reason, then we are in effect God, or pieces of God, or in any case (since Kant was not a Spinozic pantheist or Emersonian transcendentalist) we are, as Schiller puts it, putting ourselves forth as representatives of our race, where this means we're reaching a high, human ideal given to each of us by Reason, not from just observing other humans (even Jesus) who seem to have reached some level of moral excellence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Schiller even warns against traditional religious morality, which can be motivated by fear of a powerful God instead of by this inner divinity that Reason provides us with. Likewise, a socialist system is too focused on material well being, even though of course Schiller's program of art education isn't possible for people in want, and Marx and his anarchist brethren thought that taking care of material needs is not the end in itself but a means for opening us to the spiritual benefits of true freedom.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get more into what it is to be passionate (yet disinterested) in contemplating Beauty. Is this really a self-less, mystical experience, or does the increased contact with Reason make us profoundly conscious of ourselves as individuals? It seems like self-consciousness is incompatible with really appreciating Beauty, because you have to let the beautiful artwork or nature scene take over in a way to really love it. Certainly great artists are not known as the most moral individuals, as if their contemplation and creation of Beauty makes them therefore extra sensitive to other people's needs. If this is an "I love everyone, just not any individuals with their annoying problems" sort of attitude, then that's not authentic morality, at least according to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-316-brothers-82284946"&gt;Dostoevsky as we recently discussed him &lt;/a &gt;(The reference to Smerdyakov has to do with &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-317-character-82998406"&gt;The Brothers Karamazov &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, is the superfluity of fashion and other beauty (making jokes!) really a matter of play, of self-fulfillment, or is it fundamentally social?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes' treatment of British Romanticism (Keats' "Truth is Beauty" claim) is was on &lt;a href="https://subtextpodcast.com/ode-on-a-grecian-urn-keats/" target="_blank"&gt;his (sub)Text podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading further into the Romantics for the next couple of episodes in the volume &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/theory-as-practice" target="_blank"&gt;Theory as Practice: A Critical Anthology of Early German Romantic Writings &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, this time focusing on Friedrich Schlegel's essays "Concerning the Essence of Critique” (1804) the “Speech on Mythology” from his &lt;em &gt;Dialogue on Poesy &lt;/em &gt;(1799), and some of his fragments published between 1797 and 1801 in the magazines &lt;em &gt;Lyceum der Schonen Kunste &lt;/em &gt;, and the one he ran with his brother, the &lt;em &gt;Athenaeum &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Starting with letter 20 in &lt;em &gt;On the Aesthetic Education of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1795), we tell more of the story of how art is supposed to get us from sensation to thinking. This continues from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/84337765"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;and ultimately from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-318-friedrich-83695067"&gt;ep. 318 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As a Romantic, Schiller's aesthetic theory is very central to his take on epistemology and human nature. For Kant &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-105-kant-what-50223733"&gt;(whose aesthetic theory &lt;/a &gt;Schiller is working off of), Beauty is related to conceptual thinking in that it engages our faculty of conceptualization but without specific concepts. so the faculty "plays." This makes aesthetic appreciation a sort of by-product of our ability to know things. Schiller switches these elements around: Instead of the presence of conceptualization making aesthetics possible, we need aesthetic capabilities first, as an initial step in forming concepts at all. Appreciating beauty is more fundamental for us than abstract thought!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Animals, for instance, engage in play activities not (as a Darwinist would say) as survival activity, but as a superfluity, as something extra that their situation allows them, something not tied directly to getting food and propagating (though it may of course still have benefits in training them to do these things better, but it doesn't have to). Every play activity of this type is proto-artistic, and these activities free us from merely paying attention to sensation and open us up to abstraction (though animals of course likely don't get all the way there).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Do you think this argument works? Also, how does encouraging us to focus on forms and appearances make us actually care more about real, autonomous human beings?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Schiller describes Beauty as our "second nature" that makes us fully human. It also brings us together, in that through art we can grasp others' points of view.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the second half of Friedrich Schiller's &lt;em &gt;On the Aesthetic Education of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1795), with Mark, Wes, and Dylan. You might want to listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-318-friedrich-83695067"&gt;ep. 318 &lt;/a &gt;first.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While the overall argument is still that an education in appreciating art can transform the masses from desire-driven savages into rational beings worthy of representative government, starting around letter 14 through the end of the book (letter 27), we start getting into the aesthetic theory behind this claim.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We review Schiller's picture of two drives toward beholding content and beholding form, which are the result of our sensuous, animal nature on the one hand and our rational, divine nature on the other. What are these "drives" if all of causality is on the side of the material? How can the abstract and divine in itself cause us to do anything? It can't by itself; it needs to get some human desires on its side, and that's exactly what an art education is supposed to accomplish: We learn to find pleasure in something that is not strictly selfish, because Beauty provides a pleasure that is both appealing and yet disinterested (in Kant's sense, e.g. we don't actually want to eat or have sex with the work of art, but merely to be in its presence, appreciating its forms).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Good art, for Schiller, will both temper our animal side and our rational side. If either of these is too strong, Schiller says Beauty can be liquifying or melting (Wes says "attenuating") to shave off this excess, and it can also be tensioning/energizing to increase the power of whichever side of us might be lacking. Most art (or beautiful object in nature) is going to do one of these things, but Schiller insists that ideal Beauty would do both.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another interesting issue here is freedom. As beasts bound by our own desires, we're definitely not free, even though it seems we're free in the sense that we don't feel bound by the rules of society or God. Kantian moral freedom means that we recognize the laws of morality as given by Reason itself (which is something in each and every one of us, so it's like a law that we make up, even though each of us will arrive at the same conclusions about this law, so it's not subjective or relative to who's listening to Reason). So Schiller's overall goal is to make us more free in the Kantian sense: more moral. But he also recognizes that being bound by Reason in every thought we have is also a very tight constraint, and so in the aesthetic realm, where we're put at a distance &lt;em &gt;both &lt;/em &gt;from the causal order of matter (our desires) and the logical order of Reason (morality), we get the greatest feeling of freedom via aesthetic play: Our imaginations can spin freely instead of being bound like serious people to serious things. Instead, artworks create their own "logic" as we're making them, so that it's not arbitrary where the next note in your song or line in your poem or stroke in your painting will go. Total arbitrariness is never freedom, and neither of course is total constraint: The position of the artist (and to a lesser extent the spectator of Beauty in any form) is midway between these.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, does art reveal truth? Well, no. Truth is still in the realm of the divine/Reasonable. and Plato was right in being worried that lying poets could corrupt people, so Schiller warns that artists need to keep to their lane and not put forth their works of imagination as true. In fact, if artworks are being used to teach morality directly, then they're bad art; they're going beyond the appreciation of Beautiful forms.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This discussion continues with part two, and then we did also record a part three a week later to more adequately get into the final letters of the book, so you'll see that next week.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes dive deeper into the text of the first several letters of &lt;em &gt;On the Aesthetic Education of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1795). Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-318-friedrich-83695067"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are verbal descriptions of art destined to fall short? Beauty for Kant (and hence Schiller) is semi-conceptual, in that it uses the cognitive tools that are employed in making concepts, but doesn't actually come up with a concept; instead the understanding merely plays in contemplating the beautiful. Finding something beautiful is definitely &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;just identifying that it has some property (like symmetry); beauty eludes any such definition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;From the second letter: What is it to put yourself forward as a representative of your species? This is to look beyond your personal interests.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;From the third letter: What is it to say that the ideal man is "problematical"? We compare Schiller's aesthetic education program with the socialist program to change human nature by changing material conditions. People won't become moral just from Reason, but because their desires are pulled into play, and Beauty can do that.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;From the fourth letter: How can the state potentially represent the ideal human being? However citizens are supposed to unify in an ideal state, it's not through suppressing individuals a la totalitarianism. So if a philosopher or politician is trying to craft a state, you have to pay attention to the material the state is made out of, i.e. people. People serve the state only insofar as the state also serves them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we talk more about the ways of failing to be a full human: a savage (not enough Reason) or a barbarian (not enough Feeling). The latter people don't actually escape instinct; the instincts just exert themselves more secretly and perniciously, like through principles that allow us to express hostility in the name of justice.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We continue (from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/83695067"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;) working through letters 1-15 of &lt;em &gt;On the Aesthetic Education of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1795), helped by Markus Reuter. By the end of this, we get a clearer picture of what Schiller means by the experience of Beauty. We have a sensuous drive on the one hand to fill our experience with material stuff, and a form drive on the other that raises us up (a la Plato) to wonder at abstractions. These two human drives somehow combine, according to Schiller, into a "play drive," which helps us escape from the necessity of the previous kinds of drives: they in effect cancel each other out.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whereas someone stuck in the material would just obey the causation of their desires, and someone stuck in abstractions would just obey the rules that they think Reason dictates to them, having these two realms stuck together via the experience of Beauty gives the imagination free play. We can do seemingly useless things like make art, yet the art itself is not random, but it rule-like in the way the inner logic of an artwork help guide the artist's choices.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In educational terms: Teach kids art, and they'll be less selfish, more civilized, yet they won't become some awful kind of dead-inside robots through too-strict socialization.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the course of this argument, Schiller idolizes the ancient Greeks, whom he saw as civilized, reasonable, yet still very much alive. (Keep in mind this was half a century before &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-300-nietzsche-71787631"&gt;Nietzsche made a similar argument &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes continue covering this half of the book in the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/84074886"&gt;supporter-only part three &lt;/a &gt;, and ep. 319 will finish the book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Can art make us better people? Musician &lt;a href="https://www.markusreuter.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Markus Reuter &lt;/a &gt;joins Mark, Wes, and Seth to discussion the first half of &lt;em &gt;On the Aesthetic Education of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1795). Schiller was a famous poet of early German Romanticism, and this book is partly political philosophy and partly philosophy of art. The work takes the form of a series of letters. We read 1-15 for this discussion and will cover 16-27 in ep. 219.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Schiller is reacting to the French Revolution and has similar concerns to Kant (whose &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-105-kant-what-50223733"&gt;theory of art &lt;/a &gt;Schiller read just before writing this) in wondering &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-200-kant-on-21956766"&gt;what will make people enlightened enough &lt;/a &gt;to be good citizens in a truly representative government. We begin as savages, unreasoning, unfree because we're just controlled by the causal web of our desires. Government then serves only to keep us from killing each other, and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-3-hobbess-30313074"&gt;per Hobbes &lt;/a &gt;, doesn't actually have to represent our interests beyond serving this function. Then the Enlightenment came along and gave us science and "modern" philosophy, and indirectly the Industrial Revolution. But this hasn't made the masses more philosophical. Instead, we might end up being cogs in a machine, driven by "reason" in the sense that an industrial society is a creation of reason and science, but we'd still be basically slaves, just well behaved ones rather than the slaves-to-desire that society needs to keep in check. Schiller refers to these too-"reasonable" people as "barbarians" as opposed to pre-Enlightenment "savages."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The goal, though, is Enlightenment &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-10-kantian-we-30313369"&gt;in Kantian terms &lt;/a &gt;: We should all recognize the moral law as given by our own minds, so we're each self-legislating: We impose moral requirements on ourselves by recognizing that we all have an obligation to perform our duty. Though we of course learn about this due to our experience of other people telling us, it only really becomes morality when we recognize it as binding on each of us independent of any social pressures. This is what Kantian freedom amounts to: Choosing morality instead of being forced into it via the carrots and sticks of social pressures (in which case being moral could still be a matter of being a slave to your desires, e.g. not to be punished and to have others approve of you). Understanding morality in Kantian terms requires the ability to think abstractly and put aside one's pressing desires to ask what's really right.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though it takes all the way until letter #9 to get to this, Schiller's solution is Beauty: Beauty is something that is pleasurable to us, so it does still act on our animalistic/savage side, but true beauty (again, per Kant) is disinterested: I don't appreciate a beautiful painting of grapes because I want to eat those grapes, but because they are presented with a beautiful form. Form is an abstract thing, and contemplating Beauty makes us reflect (according to Schiller, following Plato) on perfection, on forms that are so beautiful that we've never actually seen them in the real world. (We considered a similar ascent from sensuous appreciation to abstract aesthetic contemplation in considering &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-298-marsilio-69472045"&gt;Ficino's take on Plato's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-298-marsilio-69472045"&gt;Symposium &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the way to civilize people, to make them able to appreciate abstract morality and thus make them worthy of citizenship in a democracy, is to teach them about Beauty (both natural beauty and artistic beauty). Art uplifts us, pulling us away from the immediately sensuous and merely "useful." And for cogs in the Industrial Revolution, as well as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Schizoid_Man" target="_blank"&gt;21st Century Schizoid Man &lt;/a &gt;(did I mention that our guest &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/AMVir9oZOHk" target="_blank"&gt;Markus is part of the extended King Crimson family &lt;/a &gt;?), music can rescue us from a hollow, utilitarian "reasonableness" by reintroducing feeling to our lives.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite Schiller's very abstract, Kantian language and the fact that most of what we read was about politics, we did our best to get Markus talking with us about actual artistic practice and education (he's also a creative educator). Markus identified "interest" (as in being interested in art or really anything else) as a key component of making us more human. This is compatible with Schiller's and Kant's description of artistic appreciation as "disinterested," because they don't mean this is in the sense of "uninterested" (like I don't care about that painting at all) but in the same of something being just interesting to experience, and not tied to particular interests in the sense of having to use it to make money, obtain food and sex, protect oneself, etc. Art is needed to ignite the specific desires that are not necessary for mere survival; it's about something that's superfluous in a good sense.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;a href="https://store.doverpublications.com/0486437396.html" target="_blank"&gt;the Dover edition that most of us read &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/540915/on-the-aesthetic-education-of-man-by-friedrich-schiller-introduction-by-alexander-schmidt-notes-by-alexander-schmidt-translated-by-keith-tribe/" target="_blank"&gt;the Penguin one that Wes read &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://armytage.net/pdsdata/Friedrich%20Schiller%20translated%20with%20a%20introduction%20by%20Reginald%20Snell%20%20On%20the%20aesthetic%20education%20of%20man%20(2004%20Dover%20Publications).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Try the book online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem138-markus-reuter/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to Markus on Mark's Nakedly Examined Music podcast &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://markusreuter.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;check out his music &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://markusreuterpodcast.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to his conversations with cutting-edge musicians &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;To conclude our discussion of the novel, we turn to the philosophies of Dmitri and Ivan. Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/82998403"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, or better yet, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-316-brothers-82284946"&gt;ep. 316 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dmitri is fixated on honor and its conflict with his romantic desires, and this causes him to make all sorts of terrible decisions that drive much of the plot of the novel.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ivan is a more complicated case, because so much of his motivations seem more subconscious. He wants to isolate himself from the evils of the world but isn't really honest with himself, so he's not capable of love, has some sadomasochism going on in his relationship with Katarina, and he even externalizes part of himself to talk to in the guise of the Devil, so we discuss some points made in that section.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we talk about the Biblical book of Job as it's addressed in the novel as a source of fascination for both Zosima and Dostoevsky himself, and we wrap up with some more ruminations on the upshot of the book and its insistence on the psychological and moral necessity of religion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can listen to the Hubert Dreyfus lectures on the book that Mark mentions on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/usxvyf3xqcQ" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube &lt;/a &gt;. Another example of a Christian criticizing the follies within Christianity as it is actually practiced in social organizations that we mentions is Erasmus' &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-302-erasmus-73338411"&gt;The Praise of Folly &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;, we'll be talking about Friedrich Schiller's &lt;em &gt;On the Aesthetic Education of Man &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Exiting the high-pressure live situation of our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-316-brothers-82284946"&gt;last episode &lt;/a &gt;, Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan ponder the 1869 novel in a more leisurely way. First, we revisit the prime "problem of evil"-related arguments in the book, and then look at textual passages to see how the various brothers deal with the problems of existence in an imperfect world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Christian story says that evil and suffering can be somehow balanced out, atoned for, or otherwise washed away, but how would this work? What attitude does a sinner need to take to be forgiven? Clearly not all evildoers will be repentant, and it seems pretty shifty if their sin can be expiated via divine fiat (e.g. Christ dying on our behalf, or as in the book, monks and other Christians taking responsibility for the sins of mankind as a unit via love). The existentialist position here seems to be that the global balance of suffering and forgiveness is really none of our concern; we can only act and love locally, and that can make life bearable for us and those around us, end of story.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to the Grand Inquisitor's argument, freedom is &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;going to be an adequate response to the problem of evil, not because many evils have nothing to do with people's free choices (e.g. natural disasters), but because freedom is too difficult for people to handle, especially if they're hungry or otherwise suffering. This idea of freedom being a curse is common among existentialists, so we talk a bit about where Dostoevsky's view falls in that range, so far as we can tell. Like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-71-martin-i-17046654" target="_blank"&gt;Buber &lt;/a &gt;, another religious existentialist, the solution to the vertigo of freedom is to focus on others and their needs, which provide pretty clear moral guidance without any sort of religious authority or objective moral law having to usurp our decision-making powers. We might not always know &lt;em &gt;how &lt;/em &gt;to help people, but the only way to better figure that out is to better communicate with and understand them. This all provides us something positive to do with ourselves, so we don't instead throw ourselves into the dramas of honor and sexual conquest (like Dmitri) or want to just check out of the whole human condition (like Ivan).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also try to fit Dostoevsky's ethics into Beauvoir's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-140-beauvoir-50859380"&gt;Ethics of Ambiguity &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. The character Smerdyakov may map on to the "sub-man," who doesn't take responsibility for his actions and is really just a brute with no apparent inner life despite some artistic skills and surface-level cleverness.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1880 novel, focusing mostly on the "Rebellion" and "Grand Inquisitor" chapters, featuring Mark, Wes, Seth and Dylan at the &lt;a href="https://caveat.nyc/" target="_blank"&gt;Caveat &lt;/a &gt;in Lower Manhattan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How can we reconcile ourselves to the existence of evil and suffering? The character Ivan Karamazov gives an argument that we just can't. This is a variation of the classic argument from evil against the existence of a good God (A good God couldn't possibly allow evil to exist, and yet evil does exist). Ivan vividly argues that some innocent children suffer horribly, and &lt;em &gt;nothing &lt;/em &gt;could justify this. Any alleged divine plan by which such suffering is necessary for a greater good would be simply monstrous. So even if you admit that God exists (which Ivan does), then the rational response to this is rebellion against God.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The fact that rational human behavior does not follow directly from an accurate assessment of the state of the world, but is instead a matter of choice, is what causes Dostoevsky to be typically categorized as an existentialist. His character Ivan sees this world and decides he must rebel, while Ivan's brother Alyosha who is hearing the story ultimately decides that he can respond by choosing to love others in very concrete ways.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These two responses are mirrored in Ivan's subsequent story wherein Jesus visits Earth during the Spanish Inquisition and is captured by the Grand Inquisitor, who explains to Jesus why the Church no longer follows the stringent teachings of Jesus, which the Inquisitor characterizes as requiring freely chosen faith. In Jesus' famous temptation in the desert by the devil, Jesus was offered the option to simply use miracles to convert stones to bread, which would feed the world and in so doing provide concrete evidence to any doubters, but he (mistakenly, according to the Inquisitor) said no. The Catholic Church, by contrast, offers its worshipers (which they aim to encompass the whole world) a plentiful diet of miracles, of bread, and of authoritative rules, so that people no longer have to choose, or struggle, or even think. The ultimate outcome of such ideas would be according to Dostoevsky a dystopia much like that described in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-215-brave-new-26827491"&gt;our last live show, &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-215-brave-new-26827491"&gt;Brave New World &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Instead, Dostoevsky demonstrates (largely through the behavior of Alyosha and his teacher Zosima) that we should embrace life with all its evils and just try to make them better, one good deed at a time. While &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-164-idiot-on-51483477"&gt;our episode 164 on Dostoevsky's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-164-idiot-on-51483477"&gt;The Idiot &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, we got a picture of a saintly character who through his sheer saintliness actually drives the people surrounding him to become worse, Alyosha is all about actually connecting with people even given their hubris and self-lacerations and trying to help them from wherever they're at. In the latter part of the book, he engages with a group of boys to help them have respect and compassion for each other.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But does this sort of practical response actually address Ivan's challenges or merely ignore them? For a more rationalist response to the problem of evil, see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-253-leibniz-42055569"&gt;our episode 253 on Leibniz' &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-253-leibniz-42055569"&gt;Theodicy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. Dostoevsky, like Leibniz and other Christian apologists, claims that we are just to limited to apprehend the grand plan, but while Leibniz thinks we can still understand abstractly &lt;em &gt;that &lt;/em &gt;it must be good, Dostoevsky doesn't think this is enough: We must as emotional beings have some way to cope with the world, and he thinks that we all (even Ivan) have an innate desire to embrace life, and this provides the key for how to "solve" the cosmological problem of evil on a personal, individual level. Again, this emphasis on developing individual attitudes toward the world is characteristic of existentialism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second part of discussion, we consider and try to respond to objections to Dostoevsky's position, first that we come up with, and then thanks to audience Q &amp;amp;A. We also consider whether this sort of analysis where we already know Dostoevsky's philosophical views (through his letters and other work) is the best way to deal with a multi-faceted novel like this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We read the &lt;a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393926330" target="_blank"&gt;Norton Critical Edition &lt;/a &gt;of the text, which includes not only an extensively tweaked version of the widely read Garnett translation by Susan McReynolds, but also many relevant passages from Dostoevsky's journals and influential critical essays.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Losing track of the characters we mention?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;To conclude our treatment of this seminal Confucian text, we consider a particularly puzzling passage about ethics and then move to politics and economics. Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/81552261"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, or better yet, with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-314-mengzi-on-80925047"&gt;part one of ep. 314 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The passage 7A17 says only "Do not do what you would not do. Do wish what you would not wish. Only be like this," and we found an article by David Nivison (p. 167 in &lt;em &gt;The Ways of Confucianism &lt;/em &gt;, 1996) that considers several different translations of this and tries to put some meat on those bare bones.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then look at Mengzi's sometimes very specific public policy prescriptions. Mengzi defends the division of labor and inequality. He describes how benevolence is a tool for leaders, and so only the humane should be in high positions. Leaders (contra Mozi) should not aim at profit, but at being virtuous, and profit will then come naturally.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Other issues we touch on include when it's OK to invade another state, what governments you should assent to work for, how to spread virtue throughout the state, and why political arguments are necessary.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Following up on our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-314-mengzi-on-80925047"&gt;previous discussion &lt;/a &gt;, we go further into the collected teachings of this early Confucian (aka Ruhist) from the late 4th century BCE. What's the best way to be a virtuous person and hence (on the ancient Chinese view, contra someone like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-14-on-30313524"&gt;Machiavelli &lt;/a &gt;) an effective leader?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We review and elaborate Mengzi's moral psychology, which is based on humaneness that grows initially out of love of family but is then developed into civic responsibility. How easy is it to be virtuous on this view? Do we need a certain level of material comfort to avoid tending toward corruption? What other environmental factors or techniques are relevant to realizing our potential to be virtuous?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about the difference between ancient Chinese and Greek/Western political philosophy: Among the Warring States philosophers, there's no question about what the best form of government is; they don't consider anything aside from having a single leader. Still, they differ a lot in terms of what the responsibilities, and so self-imposed restrictions, bear on the leader, and Mengzi (perhaps following Mozi) was revolutionary is explicitly stating that the point of the state is to serve the people.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we consider Mengzi's take on destiny, which we can read as his response to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-313-mozis-one-80282412" target="_blank"&gt;Mozi &lt;/a &gt;, who argued that the Confucians' embrace of destiny made them inactive.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/80925047"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on the teachings of Mengzi from ca. 350 BCE. Our guest has gone, and so Mark, Wes, Dylan and Seth dive into textual quotes, starting with verse 2A6 which says that we all have "sprouts" of humaneness, rightness, propriety, and wisdom. In a move that was not actually in Confucius, Mengzi claims that everyone is basically good, in that we all have these potentialities that good upbringing can bring to fruition. But why claim that we have something in our soul that can grow toward good but deny that we have an evil one?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then delve into chapter 6 which goes more into moral psychology. Unlike Mozi, Mengzi doesn't consider human nature to be simply malleable such that the people can effectively follow along with their leader, whatever that leader's moral behavior may be. In other words, ethics is built into human nature and not merely a contingent matter of social history. He considers and rejects theories that maybe some virtues are part of human nature ("internal") and some other requirements are products of social decision ("external").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This should remind us of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-45-moral-hume-15467492"&gt;Western moral sense theory (e.g. Hume)&lt;/a &gt;, and like these figures, Mengzi connects apprehensions of artistic value to ethics. He claims that we all have the same tastes (again, if not corrupted by deprivation or some other trauma), and so (when we understand ethics) all acknowledge that the same actions are good. However, figuring out the correct action given very idiosyncratic circumstances may take exceptional wisdom. So different sages of the past may have displayed different behaviors (e.g. one chose to advise a leader, one chose to snub him), but this just makes ethics particularistic, i.e. dependent on circumstance, and not relative. There is one and only one right thing to do in every situation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plus, qi (pronounced "chee"): what is it, and how does it play into Chinese ethics by connecting us in a physical rather than merely social way?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A couple of new philosopher names that come up: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangism" target="_blank"&gt;Yang Zhu &lt;/a &gt;(or Yang Ju) is an ethical egoist (everyone is selfish and should be) that Mengzi argues against. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaozi" target="_blank"&gt;Gaozi &lt;/a &gt;was a contemporary of Mengzi who's put forward in chapters 6 as an opponent who thinks that human nature is entirely malleable. There are no surviving texts written by Gaozi.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next episode, we'll spend more time on this book, getting into the political ramifications and other topics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Don't fail to get your ticket to PEL Live (and Streaming) for April 15 at 7pm ET (or you can watch the stream later): &lt;a href="https://www.caveat.nyc/events/partially-examined-life-4-15-2023" target="_blank"&gt;partiallyexaminedlife.com/live &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On books 2, 4, and 6 of the collected teachings of the greatest early interpreter of Confucian thought, from the late 4th century BCE. The full foursome are joined by &lt;a href="https://www.sjc.edu/news/tutors-talk-books-krishnan-venkatesh" target="_blank"&gt;Krishnan Venkatesh &lt;/a &gt;of the St. John's College Eastern Classics program.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Since this will be the first installment of two full discussions (i.e. four parts) on this book, and our only one with Krishnan, we took the opportunity to interview him on the challenges of teaching Eastern texts in a "great books" setting and connecting them to Western philosophical concerns.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We use the idea of filiality (a.k.a. filial piety, which is serving your parents) as a way into the current text, given the different role this value has in Chinese vs. Western culture. Loving your parents is the way into all moral thinking for Mencius, but given how bad and/or demanding that parents can be, how we don't choose them, what does it mean for this to be the fundamental moral commandment? (Krishnan mentions the Emperor Shun, one of Mencius' moral models, whose parents actually tried to kill him.) Does respecting your parents mean doing whatever they say, or fulfilling their objective needs (food, clothing)? What is it to really treat them with dignity? We talk about this in terms of the creature-creator relation and even bring in Jane Austen.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/mencius/9780231122047" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the Bloom translation we read &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/23421/Mengzi.pdf?sequence=2 &amp;amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank"&gt;try this "online teaching translation &lt;/a &gt;."

Is the lack of this well-being why people act badly? We talk more about Mozi's arguments against elaborate funerals and music (and art in general).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plus, we look at Mozi's words against war and whether his defense of some past wars makes any sense. Did Mozi really believe in ghosts, or did he just think that believing in ghosts will scare people into righteous behavior? What other means does Mozi recommend to encourage morality? We also discuss the Will of Heaven, identification with one's superior, and fatalism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We will not actually be reading Han Feizi's legalist school soon, so you might want to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Fei" target="_blank"&gt;read about him &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next time &lt;/strong &gt;: We'll be reading books 2, 4, and 6 of the Mengzi (aka Mencius).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the central Mohist text, collecting the teachings of Mozi (aka Mo Tzu), from the Chinese Warring States period around 430 B.C.E., with guest &lt;a href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/tzuchien-tho" target="_blank"&gt;Tzuchien Tho &lt;/a &gt;joining Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth. The full book is very long, so we used the portions translated by Burton Watson in his &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/mo-tzu/9780231086080" target="_blank"&gt;Mo Tzu: Basic Writings &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1963).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Tzuchien was previously on our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-159-confucius-51032578"&gt;Confucius &lt;/a &gt;(aka Kongzi) episode, and as we're next planning to do Mencius (aka Mengzi), the most prominent proponent of the Ru tradition after Confucius, Tzuchien suggested we cover Mozi, who was arguing with the Ruhists (Confucians) in between the two figures.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whereas Confucius recommends respect for one's parents as the prime ethical duty, Mozi argues that we should love everyone equally, not giving special weight to our family members. Like the other Chinese Warring States period philosophers, Mozi was especially interested in providing advice to leaders, and he warned against picking people for high office based on nepotism or wealth or beauty. Instead, pick the most qualified person, wherever they may come from.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mozi is often considered the first consequentialist. A doctrine should be pursued, or a belief should be held, insofar as it will help the people. He attributed all the war that was happening at the time to partiality, to favoring one's clan over others. War-mongering helps no one, or at least causes far more hurt than help, so only defensive wars should be waged.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In addition to looking to the practical consequences of a doctrine, Mozi (like his opponents) relied heavily on the models of ancient sage kings. Some of these kings had in fact waged war, and not always defensively. Mozi explained that in these cases, the sage-kings were acting out the Will of Heaven in punishing wicked leaders. The Mohists believed that Heaven rewards the virtuous and punishes the unrighteous. Why? Mozi claimed this was observable fact, recorded in ancient texts. It's also common sense: The Will of Heaven is manifest in the reactions of the people. A bad leader by definition is one that's abusive to the people, and if the people don't support a regime, it won't last long. If such a regime is invaded, the people will be happy to have new, less cruel leaders.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, the more fundamental reason to believe that Heaven rewards the good and punishes the bad is, for Mozi, the fact that such a belief will motivate people to act well. Mozi argues against those who believe instead in fate: that one's success in life is fundamentally out of our control, determined by a Heaven that doesn't care if we act well or not. This doctrine, claims Mozi, drives people to stop trying; it leads to failure, and so is a bad doctrine. Mozi doesn't actually make explicit this distinction between the truth of a doctrine and whether it has beneficial effects. Rather, he argues that both are the case: We should accept a doctrine because of its effects, because we can confirm it by observation (which mostly involves testimony, i.e. others' observations), and because some of those observations concern the activities of the sage kings, which both Mozi and his opponents believed were models of virtue that we should emulate (though they therefore had different interpretations of what those virtues involved).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another important Mohist doctrine is the idea that subordinates in a state should go along with the opinions of their leaders. Of course, the leaders should be virtuous (following their superior, the Son of Heaven, i.e. the Emperor, who in turn should be following Heaven itself), but conformity is important in itself, even if the superior is in error, because Mozi thought that diversity of thought leads to chaos, which (like for Hobbes) is so destructive so as to be avoided at all costs.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mozi was also against music and excessive funeral rites, as these were just self-indulgence by the wealthy and did not contribute to the good of the people. Mozi says explicitly that human needs are for food, clothing, and shelter (enabling rest); he ignores any emotional or spiritual needs that might overrule these fundamental physical needs. Apart from these innately human physical needs, Mozi implies that human nature is wholly malleable, and that people will tend to (correctly) follow their leaders (and if they don't, use physical punishment). So claiming that people just do inherently love their families more than others, that we are partial according to human nature, just doesn't work for Mozi. People are perfectly capable of being impartial, and his argument for this is that impartiality produces the best effects: If you value your parents, the best way to care for them is actually to care for others' parents too, because then the offspring of those other parents will reciprocate by caring for your parents. Because this doctrine (altruistic impartial love) is most beneficial to you, you can and should follow it, even if your love seems currently confined to your own family.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/mo-tzu/9780231086080" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or try &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/motzubasicwritings" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://hristowar.wixsite.com/chriswarr" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Warr &lt;/a &gt;(aka Solomon Grundy).

Listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-311-dao-de-78938493"&gt;ep. 311 &lt;/a &gt;first.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this part of the discussion we cover these chapters:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;7, which tells you to excel by not trying so hard.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;38, which poetically summarizes Daoist psycho-spiritual (deep) virtues as opposed to Confucian behavioral (shallow) virtues.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;16, on "emptiness" (or "tranquility" or "equilibrium") and "returning to one's roots."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;27, which says that experts in a given area can forget about the rules that beginners have to follow. They can flexibly use the materials (people) at hand and don't have to reject anything because it's not covered in the manual.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;37, which is a very puzzling chapter about how the sage never acts, yet nothing is undone, and how after the creatures have transformed of their own accord, if they then get out of line, then the sage can get them back on course with "the nameless uncarved block."

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 2/10/23 between our two &lt;em &gt;Daodejing &lt;/em &gt;discussions, the full foursome reflects on the interpretive challenges of that text and then consider the activity of reading philosophy and Daoism in particular as self-help. This issue should not of course be confused with the question, "Is studying philosophy beneficial for your live?" but sure enough, we pretty much slide into discussing that latter question. Of course it is!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Who is this Theodore Brooks that has graced our presence on ep. 311 and who we liked enough to ask back for ep. 312? Note that Karyn Lai that Theo mentions is the prof. who's working with Peter Adamson on his History of Philosophy in China series. Watch her talk about the &lt;em &gt;I Ching &lt;/em &gt;(Book of Changes), which though not in itself a work of philosophy is a foundational source for some of the ideas about opposites that went into the &lt;em &gt;Daodejing &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also get some introductory comments from Dylan about his connection to Chinese philosophy given that he wasn't on the last Nightcap, and to start off, Mark gives some announcements and reminders about our supporter &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/rGrHdCzP8v" target="_blank"&gt;Discord server &lt;/a &gt;, the streaming option for &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/live" target="_blank"&gt;our 4/15 live show &lt;/a &gt;, and our network podcasts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-311-dao-de-78938493"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;with guest Theodore Brooks on the central Daoist text attributed to Laozi. We start with more discussion of practical vs. metaphysical interpretations of the first chapter. In either case, Laozi recommends not being too self-conscious; you want to be fully present in your activities, open to the subtle cues of your environment, without too much self-reflection, nit-picking, agendas, or other types of over-thinking distracting you. Words and analysis are useful in their place, of course, but life is best lived partially examined. See, one can interpret this text to support many agendas!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One more Chinese term that comes up here and in many places in the text is "wanwu," which is not a wu-form indicating not-something, but just means everything, or it's often translated as "the ten thousand things," or our philosopher translator Ames calls it "everything that is happening" just to hammer home the point that he thinks that the text has a metaphysical picture of a world made of events, not things.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Other chapters covered include:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;2, which ambiguously tells us about the relation of things to their opposites: Is it that fixing something (such as virtue) in language (much less codifying it via a Confucian social ethic) falsifies it? Or does the presence of a quality imply that its opposite exists, which could be a psychological claim about something making us inevitably think of its opposite, or perhaps it's a metaphysical claim that by using language to pick out something, we thereby also create its opposite as its necessary partner?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;4, which makes various mystical sounding claims about the Dao including its being ever-replenishing, vast, older than (or otherwise prior to) even the ancestral gods. It's maybe like the chaos that preceded creation according to some religious traditions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;11, which is about "wu," which is literally just "not" but which as a philosophical term means emptiness, absence, space. Laozi compares this to an empty pot, the space between the spokes of a wheel, the emptiness of doors and rooms: In all these cases, what is literally nothing is what enables us to accomplish something. So maybe wu is actually better translated as "potency" or "potentiality," in that it is the space in which novel things can appear if we don't preclude their appearance by, for instance, fixed (Confucian) ideas about the "proper" way to think, see, and act.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;6, which talks about "the female" (as in the womb) and "the valley," which are, again, forms of emptiness that enable growth and nurturing. These metaphors come up repeatedly in the text. Laozi also refers to the Dao as an "abyss," which might not mean nothingness so much as no-thing-ness, i.e. language hasn't come along to carve individual things out of it yet. Seth compares the Dao to Eros for the Greeks, which is a primal force (a felt lack that an organism tries to fill) that is the necessary spark for making everything work together productively.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;12, which talks about how "the five colors blind our eyes" and "the five notes deafen our ears." This adds to the "don't desire too much" ethic to emphasize inner depth over gaudy distractions. This may just be restating the point about being in the flow of existence, resisting the urge to stop and make judgments, especially ones that involve desire and hence control.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;38, which introduces the notion of "de," i.e. virtue (contrasting with "ren" for the Confucian, which is a particular kind of social virtue). It's the ones who don't strive for virtue that are actually the most virtuous, according to Louzi.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;5, which added the term "straw dogs" to our lexicon, and is very hard to interpret, because it's saying that both the universe ("heaven and earth") and Daoist sages treat people like these straw dogs, which sounds pretty bad. Is it saying that life isn't fair, or that it isn't "fair," meaning it doesn't follow what the Confucians erroneously call ethical behavior (i.e. ren, which is the character used here)? Is "straw dog" (traditionally understood to be a construct sacrificed on a fire during or after a ritual) equivalent to "trash," or is the point to emphasize that everything has its time and purpose? This chapter also cautions against speaking (or learning?) too much.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next episode, we're going to treat more of these chapters!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;The &lt;em &gt;Daodejing &lt;/em &gt;(or &lt;em &gt;Tao Te Ching &lt;/em &gt;) from around 500 BCE, attributed considerably after its production to Laozi (or Lao Tzu according to an older but still prevalent style of transliteration; it just means "old master") is the fundamental text of Daoism (Taoism), but what they hell does it mean? Well, it depends on which of its hundreds of translators you ask. We selected &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3DSKW17" target="_blank"&gt;the "philosophical translation" by Roger Ames and David Hall &lt;/a &gt;(2003). However, it's good to have &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/religion/files/pdf/Tao_Teh_Ching_Translations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;other opinions &lt;/a &gt;ready to hand: The ones Mark and Dylan read in school were by &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3HS8gxc" target="_blank"&gt;D.C. Lau &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3jDg5ib" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Hendricks &lt;/a &gt;respectively. We also brought on a guest PEL listener who studied Chinese philosophy, Theodore Brooks, whose favorite translation is by &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3JOJXm7" target="_blank"&gt;Philip Ivanhoe &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"Dao" in ancient Chinese means "way," as in a path to follow to get somewhere. It also has a less common meaning of speech, so the spoken way to be would refer to a doctrine about how to best live your life. Like Confucius' &lt;em &gt;Analects &lt;/em &gt;and Sunzi's &lt;em &gt;Art of War &lt;/em &gt;, this was written explicitly as a guide (at least in part) for political leaders, so we start by considering the book's political philosophy, which is definitely against coercion and war (as the worst kind of coercion). It's also against the creation of a lot of explicit ideals and rules that are meant to inspire people, but which actually end up leaving them discouraged and envious when they can't live up to the ideals and don't receive the honors tied to them. They may also be straight-jacketed by ill-advised attempts to reform their natural patterns of growth and ways of interacting with each other and the world. Instead, the text recommends "wuwei," which can be translated as non-coercive action, or alternately as doing nothing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We wrap up this first half of the conversation by starting to interpret the notorious first chapter of the book. &lt;a href="http://www.bopsecrets.org/gateway/passages/tao-te-ching.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Look at 175+ translations of this &lt;/a &gt;. Literally, the first line reads, "The Dao that Daos is not the eternal (or maybe unchanging or true) Dao." This relies on the two meanings of Dao as both path (or often it's just untranslated; maybe it's referring not just of a way of doing things but some kind of undefined mystical thing a la God), and speech. So if you think you can talk about the Dao, then that Dao that you're discussing is in some sense not the real Dao. Philosophy at its deepest level is inevitably beyond speech.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We just saw this same sentiment expressed in an arguably very mundane sense with Wittgenstein: It could be that you can't talk about the Dao because the Dao is made up of non-verbal habits. So you can't really talk about the essence of being a great chef or mechanic, because these crafts involve a know-how that you can only grasp through activity, though you can certainly get verbal lessons as part of your training. However, the massive appeal of this text as spiritual philosophy would be pretty deflated if everyone just read this as a manual for keeping your cool, and even in that first chapter, we get the metaphysical/mystical idea that the Dao is the "mother of all things," so some readers take this book as a work of mysticism, where we're using these ambiguous verses as a roundabout way of grasping deep truths about the universe.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Chapters we cover in this part of the discussion include:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;17, which includes wuwei and also the Chinese term ziran as spontaneity or literally "self-soing," as in being yourself without someone else coercing you whether physically or through imposing their ideas of morality on you.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;18, which states that when Confucian values are widespread, then the state actually suffers, and also talks about how opposites always imply each other. This metaphysical/conceptual path undermines any ethical program of rooting out the bad, because the good will always give rise to its opposite.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;19, which continues this logic: If you get rid of the Confucian efforts, you get people acting naturally (ziran), which is better overall.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;3, which is more of the same, but adds the point that the leader should fill the people's bellies over imposing (Confucian) philosophy on them, and introduces more "wu" terms: wuzhi, which is no-knowledge, which maybe means having knowledge without feeling the need to fit it into a system, which again resonates with Wittgenstein), and wuyu, which is no-desire, or desire that does not seek to possess and control its object.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;We actually conclude with the beginning of our discussion of chapter 1, which also includes another wu form: wuming, which means not named. Not only is the Dao not something we can speak about, but there's something problematic about naming, such that a name that can be named is not the real (constant, eternal) name. This is a general point about how language posits a world of static things that can be named, but like Heraclitus, Laozi embraces a metaphysics that makes events central, not things. So naming something is like (to use Heraclitus' metaphor) pointing at a part of a river and naming it, but then when you turn back later, that part has actually changed. Names are fine for practical use (remembering the place where the river is typically most easily crossed), but don't actually follow the way the world is actually carved. Maybe it isn't really carved at all, and the single, eternal Dao is all there ultimately is (this interpretation would make Laozi more like Parmenides).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;It's illustrative to compare Daoism to Stoicism and Epicureanism, as they both recommend keeping your desires in check and adapting to nature. When Buddhism reached China, it was highly influenced by the local Daoism to become Chan (and then in Japan, Zen) Buddhism, which we'll cover in the future. Our previous discussion on Daoism was from way back in our episode 12 in 2009.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This discussion continues with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/78938491"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Mark, Wes, and Seth anticipate our upcoming Dao De Jing discussion, talk about Dostoevsky's life and what makes &lt;em &gt;The Brothers Karamazov &lt;/em &gt;worth your time to read. But what about &lt;em &gt;War and Peace &lt;/em &gt;? Is there a reason for us to not be covering this novel as the Russians are being so naughty war-wise now?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Should we do an episode on Hebrew Biblical ethics to compare with Confucius and Greek ethics? Who should our next existentialist be? And of course we talk about Chat GPT, because, well, isn't everyone? Can we get a PEL cult going? Finally, on flying to go see shows. And yes, Mark is right about &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EH0dq02TOPQ" target="_blank"&gt;the grody Peter Frampton song &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;Hey supporters!

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We continue picking at Ludwig Wittgenstein's &lt;em &gt;On Certainty &lt;/em &gt;(written 1951), with Mark, Wes, Dylan and Seth now supplemented by guest Chris Heath, who is a guy who's very into philosophy of science who runs a Discord philosophy server.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is really the fourth discussion in this series; we recommend you start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-307-g-e-moore-76336587"&gt;ep. 307 on G.E. Moore &lt;/a &gt;, or at least &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-309-on-part-77781029"&gt;ep. 309 &lt;/a &gt;where we started discussing this book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is Wittgenstein's philosophy of science as it's reflected in this book? The term in this book analogous to "paradigm" for Kuhn or "research program" for Lakatos is "Weltbild," i.e. world-picture, which he contrasts with world-view (Weltanschauung), as in the Marxist or the Daoist world-view. In a Weltbild, there are foundations that W. argues are too basic to even be considered propositions (claims); they are foundations for actions, like the assumption that physical objects exist, that we know our own names, and that simple perceptions ("this is my hand") are veridical. These are the Moorean propositions we've been discussing in our past three episodes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A foundation of a Weltanschauung, on the other hand, is something that can be coherently questioned, like maybe the Marxist labor theory of value is foundational for Marxism, or the Daoist's claim that the Dao that can be spoken of is not the ultimate, eternal Dao. Those claims are central for understanding those world-views, and if refuted, perhaps undermine the whole view, but they are (arguably) not methodologically foundational in the same way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Kuhnian paradigm of Newtonian physics (for example) seems to involve both kinds of claims. On the one hand, there are Newton's three laws of motion and other central claims about time and space (which quantum physicists have disputed), but there are also methodological assumptions about how one's observations of measuring equipment must in general be reliable, how the figures you've just written down in your lab notebook won't magically change themselves, how we can perform mathematical calculations and always get the same answers, etc. So Wittgenstein's account might not be a full-blown philosophy of science, but it concerns these basic epistemic approaches which are not necessarily consistent across all scientific approaches. For instance, one methodological assumption of Newtonian science is that observed data doesn't tend to change just because an observation has taken place, but this is something that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle challenges.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I would say also that the Daoist claim that ultimate philosophy cannot be verbalized also challenges our everyday conception that the way the world is can be put into words, or insofar as it can't, that's because some truths are truths about qualia (how the world looks or feels or sounds to us), and we don't have agreed-upon names for all possible experiences. For a Daoist (and for Wittgenstein himself, famously), some truths are too deep to articulate. So this line between Weltbild and Weltanschauung is not very firm, more a matter of whether of which type of foundationalism you're emphasizing in describing a set of beliefs. A Weltbild is not a set of claims that we can (from within the picture) evaluate as to their truth or falsity, but a background picture that we use to make such evaluations.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So we try to figure out how these new-to-this-episode terms relate to language games, relativism, testing, testimony, and more. What if we as a society are just playing the wrong language games?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on 1/12/13, Mark, Wes, and Dylan first talk about our upcoming &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/liveshow/" target="_blank"&gt;Dostyevsky live show &lt;/a &gt;(April 15 in NYC; we hope to have tickets on sale soon, and supporters will get first crack at them) and talk about our debate over translations of &lt;em &gt;The Brothers Karamazov &lt;/em &gt;, as inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/the-translation-wars" target="_blank"&gt;this article &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.commentary.org/articles/gary-morson/the-pevearsion-of-russian-literature/" target="_blank"&gt;this one &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dostoevsky/comments/juuytp/regarding_the_many_translations_of_fyodor/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the reddit page that actually pulls passages from both translations &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth then finally joins to talk about whether given the translations we can tell the difference between Russian authors, whether the Brothers K. is mostly about religion (and so not philosophy proper of interest to non-theists). Do the three brothers map on to the three stages in Kierkegaard's &lt;em &gt;Either-Or &lt;/em &gt;? We might read that soon. But first, we'll be doing some Chinese philosophy: the &lt;em &gt;Daodejing &lt;/em &gt;, and (decided since we recorded this) Mozi (of the Mohist school, contemporary in ancient China with the Daoists and Confucians), and we're debating whether to have a third episode on Mengzi (a.k.a. Mencius).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also for this Nightcap revisited our Wittgenstein's &lt;em &gt;Philosophical Investigations &lt;/em &gt;episodes (&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-55-on-17043946"&gt;55 &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-56-more-on-17044181"&gt;56 &lt;/a &gt;) to see if we have anything to add about language games, rule following, and private language to help lay the groundwork for second discussion of &lt;em &gt;On Certainty &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes suggests we read &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tomasello" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Tomasello &lt;/a &gt;on the origin of language; I'm thinking we may do a run of episodes on language after the live show.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing the notes Ludwig Wittgenstein made at the end of his life in 1951 that were published as &lt;em &gt;On Certainty &lt;/em &gt;in 1969, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These were in direct response to the essays by G.E. Moore that we discussed in episodes &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-307-g-e-moore-76336587"&gt;307 &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-308-moores-of-76962017"&gt;308 &lt;/a &gt;, so we talk about the status of so-called "Moorean propositions" like "physical objects exist," "the world is more than 50 years old," and "this is my hand" that appear to be empirical observations of the world but which also don't seem to be open to realistic doubts. Wittgenstein claims that we shouldn't even claim to &lt;em &gt;know &lt;/em &gt;such things, because "knowing" implies some method of investigating and making sure, whereas for Moorean propositions, we can't even imagine how we would make such an investigation. If someone says they're not sure that objects don't cease to exist when we're not looking at them or that 12 X 12 really does equal 144, then we might regard them as crazy, or just not yet competent with the relevant activities (like babies don't have object permanence before a certain point, and certainly one might just not know how to do multiplication).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Following his way of thinking about things laid down in his &lt;em &gt;Philosophical Investigations &lt;/em &gt;(see our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-55-on-17043946"&gt;episode 55 &lt;/a &gt;), Wittgenstein thinks that the meanings of words are specific to their linguistic contexts, which he compares to games, in that they have certain rules. Knowing what word or phrase means is just knowing how it works in some language games. So there are certain contexts where it might be appropriate to say "I know this is my hand," like if a doctor is testing your cognitive abilities or if you're just learning English and trying to show you know what "hand' means to your teacher. But in "normal" contexts, there would be no reason to say such a thing. It goes without saying.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what about the context of doing philosophy, or in particular, asking skeptical questions of the kind that Moore was trying to respond to? Wittgenstein argues (insofar as he actually argues anything in these musings) that the skeptical position is self-undermining, that it's not a coherent language game at all. If you were to doubt that you could correctly identify your hand as a hand, you may as well doubt that you know the meanings of words or your sanity altogether.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Wq4qQU" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/oncertainty00witt" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-308-moores-of-76962017"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, we quickly complete our treatment of G.E. Moore’s "Proof of the External World" (1939) and move on to consider "Certainty" (1941).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the latter paper, Moore considers various "obvious" statements about his current situation (in my case now: I am writing this, I am sitting down, I have fingers, I am in my house on earth, etc.). These are all contingent truths, not truths of logic (not a priori). However, once I'm in this situation and know them to be true now, does it make sense to say (Moore asks) if they right now could be false, despite my knowledge of their truth? This is not asking the counter-factual claim of could I have decided not to be sitting here writing (of course I could have), but about the way we use the word "possible": Is it possible given that you know you are in such-and-such a location (you are certain of this) that this belief might possibly be false? Moore says no.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another way of putting this: given that I am sitting down, can I know that I am sitting down? Is there some possibility of its actually being false right now (e.g. we're in the matrix) such that I'm not warranted in saying that my sitting position is knowledge held with the highest level of certainty (if that's not a redundant way of phrasing it)?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Moore lays out the distinctions between "I am certain.," "I know for certain," and "it is certain." Part of the point is to distinguish between certainty and infallibility. Being "certain" is compatible with actually being wrong, as in the case where the person is certain of his hand, yet is actually in the Matrix and so no claims about observation or visible bodies as spoken by the Matrix-housed individuals will turn out to be true. Moore claims that it's more likely that the theoretical considerations that give rise to such doubts are in error than that the everyday observation is faulty. He also seems to claim that it may not even be coherent to think that, for example, we're &lt;em &gt;always &lt;/em &gt;dreaming (and so seemingly veridical perception may be faulty), because the only way we can understand dreaming to exist is by its contrast with waking perception. Do you buy any of this?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A secondary source some of us found helpful was Avrum Stroll's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3imegW2" target="_blank"&gt;Moore and Wittgenstein on Certainty &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On G.E. Moore’s "Proof of the External World" (1939) and "Certainty" (1941).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Similar to the essay we covered in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-307-g-e-moore-76336587"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;, Moore is defending common sense realism against idealists who claim that the external world is not mind-independent but is instead made up of ideas, and also skeptics who claim that we can't know (or know with certainty) anything about the external world. Instead of considering general claims that everyone presumably knows like "We as people have bodies and experiences and exist in space" and "The earth has existed for many years before we were born," Moore here argues based on "this is a hand" (while holding up his hand) to supposedly prove that external objects exist.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There's some set-up in the "External World" essay before he makes this argument, because of course the skeptic and idealist would be fine with you claiming that you have a perception of a hand, just not with the argument that this thing, the hand, is an object with mind-independent reality, and that we can know that (in fact, it's totally obvious). He first distinguishes between things "presented in space," which could include, for instance, my pain (which is presented as being in my foot, for instance); from things "met with in space," which include exclude such private experiences but which imply that the thing would be there to be potentially met with even if no one is actually meeting with it (perceiving it or thinking about it or in any way mentally interacting with it). With this analysis, Moore thinks he's conceptually shown that things "met with in space," which include all physical objects (as well as shadows and other things), are thus external to our minds: They are objective and would exist even if perceiving creatures did not exist at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;With that move, the philosophical work has been done. All he then has to show in his famous hand proof is that one thing met with in space exists (actually he points out &lt;em &gt;both &lt;/em &gt;of his hands, so he's proved "things" instead of just a single "thing"), and that proves that the idealists are wrong.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what about the skeptics? Moore uses the premise that these hands exist along with his conceptual analysis of what hands really are (physical objects, i.e. met with in space) to prove his general conclusion, but why would the skeptic accept that Moore has warrant to state the premise that his hands exist? As we'll consider in our upcoming episode on Wittgenstein's &lt;em &gt;On Certainty &lt;/em &gt;, Wittgenstein was very struck my this: On the one hand, it's pretty inconceivable that you could think that you're looking at your own hand and be making a mistake about it. Wittgenstein can imagine some particular situations where that's the case (like you've taken drugs or are an amputee), but in ordinary situations, you can't make a mistake, and so it's actually weird to say you "know" that that's your hand, because knowledge implies some potential doubt and some method of proof, where the hand just seems too immediate to allow for either of these.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the other hand (to continue this unfortunate verbal convention given that we're talking about the existence of hands), Moore is clearly just not taking the skeptic seriously that maybe all of our perceptions could be mistaken (because we're a brain in a vat, dreaming, in the Matrix, etc.). While Wittgenstein is then going to distinguish between the two different contexts ("language games") of ordinary interaction (where you can't be mistaken about the hand), and philosophical epistemology (where such doubts can at least be usefully entertained), Moore just says that investigation has to stop somewhere, and there are just some types of claims that we can know with certainty without being able to give reasons for why we know them. An argument uses premises to prove a conclusion. If we always demanded "well, sure, those premises lead to that conclusion, but you have to prove your premises!" then arguments would go on forever. You'd come up with a further argument to prove a premise, but then your premises in that argument would need to be similarly proved, ad infinitum. So we have a choice of just saying that we know absolutely nothing (and what would motivate this? Some claims about epistemology that would themselves be unproven and hence unknown!) or that there are some things that we just know without proof. We'll talk more about the status of these "Moorean sentences" in part two of this discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read the essays online: "&lt;a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/philosophy/epistemology/1939-moore.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Proof of an External World &lt;/a &gt;" and "&lt;a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/epistclass/moore.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Certainty &lt;/a &gt;."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/76336587"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "A Defense of Common Sense" (1925), now down to Mark, Wes, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get into the nitty gritty of Moore's argument: Against idealism, Moore argues that physical facts are in now way dependent on mental facts; for instance, the existence and position of the moon don't depend on anyone's beliefs about the moon. Reality is mind independent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When you hold up your hand and identify it as your hand, what's going on? On Moore's account, you are seeing a sense datum: a certain part of the surface of your hand that represents the hand as a whole. So what does "represents" mean here? If we're only perceiving the sense data and not the hand, what warrants us to believe in the hand?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Moore considers three options for the ontology of sense data: A direct realist says that the sense data literally are part of the hand, even though everyone's perspective (sense data) when they look at the hand are slightly different. A representationalist says that the sense data are not the object but instead stand in a definite relation to the object (Moore thinks this relation is basic and unanalyzable). A dispositionalist defines the object as a something out in the world that causes all of the perceptions that we have of it. Moore finds problems with all of these, but they increasingly diverge from common sense.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As we'll see in episode 308 when we talk about Moore's "&lt;a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/philosophy/epistemology/1939-moore.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Proof of an External World &lt;/a &gt;" (planned for this episode, but we were too slow working through this), Moore's position was a version of the second option: Sense data are not the same as the object, but we don't just have the sense data; we also apprehend a proposition that the object exists (and has some properties)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark refers to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-30-on-and-11381040"&gt;our episode on Schopenhauer's Kantian epistemology &lt;/a &gt;.

A modern critique of Moore's epistemology is &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-154-wilfrid-50992909"&gt;Sellars' argument against sense-data &lt;/a &gt;, i.e. "the myth of the given."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "A Defense of Common Sense" (1925), featuring Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan. Various philosophers will tell you that the only thing you experience is your own ideas, and hence the world outside of your mind is something wholly unknowable, or if it is knowable, it must be because those supposedly physical objects are actually somehow ideas as well. Moore defends our pre-philosophical certainty that we do know many things about the world against these skeptics and idealists.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While some particular observation of the world may turn out to be wrong (e.g. I see a stick that looks bent but is really straight), there's no justification for doubting all observations, and in fact our entire language for expressing doubt assumes that there are other people, that we live together in a physical world which has existed for many years before humans existed, that our senses and scientific instruments help us observe things about this world, and that physical objects exist and objectively have many of the properties we tend to ascribe to them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To argue against "common sense" is to argue that "I know that everyone believes these things, but we are unwarranted in doing so." The first part of this, "I know that everyone believes," means that the skeptic already believes in other people that have (allegedly mistaken) beliefs, so this skeptical position is self-refuting.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sophia-project.org/uploads/1/3/9/5/13955288/moore_commonsense.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the essay online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/75818700"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on Ronald Dworkin's "Unenumerated Rights: Whether and How Roe Should be Overruled" (1992) and the &lt;em &gt;Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization &lt;/em &gt;(2021) decision featuring guest Robin Linsenmayer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dworkin thinks that the distinction between enumerated and unenumerated rights really doesn't make sense. All legal language is vague and requires interpretation. For instance, does "freedom of speech" include freedom of writing? Does it include flag burning? Judges always have to look beyond the literal words of the law to determine how to apply it to new cases. He doesn't see any fundamental difference between such an argument about flag burning and the consideration of whether Due Process includes the right to privacy and whether this in turn includes abortion. Judges always use interpretation to make judgments, and according to Dworkin they are guided by legal principles given by the Constitution as a whole, its purpose, and the society that it's trying to achieve.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In judging "the Constitution," judges are also judging the way that the Constitution has been interpreted in the past, i.e. precedent. The reasoning in Casey v. Planned Parenthood (1992) that previously affirmed the central findings of Roe relied in no small way on stare decisis: Even if Roe was itself underdetermined by the law, the fact that the court made that decision, which was then relied on by other decisions, provided a key rationale for Casey to say that Roe is established law that should not be overturned without some strong reason; an opinion by a future court that Roe was wrongly decided shouldn't be enough. Alito rejects stare decisis in Dobbs, citing past cases like Brown v. Board of Education that overturned the legality of segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson. The Dobbs dissent points out how that was different: In experiencing Jim Crow, we as a society more clearly learned that segregation is not compatible with equal treatment. Nothing comparable was learned by our society under Roe, the dissent claims, and so precedent should prevail.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Beyond this defense of abortion rights, Dworkin gives an idiosyncratic account of exactly what the state's interest in potential life is. He claims that because abortion is an important decision involving life and death, the state may legislate our moral climate such that people shouldn't necessarily be able to make the decision to abort without really thinking hard about it. So he would be OK with waiting periods and such. This interest stems from a different kind of claim than one related to the rights of an actual being. It's rather an interest in "life in general," much like a general interest in the environment or in some aspect of intellectual culture. Do you think there are legitimate state interests that don't stem in some way from personal rights?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode &lt;/strong &gt;: We're discussing G.E. Moore's "&lt;a href="http://fitelson.org/proseminar/moore_adocs.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;A Defense of Common Sense &lt;/a &gt;" (1925) and "&lt;a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/philosophy/epistemology/1939-moore.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Proof on an External World &lt;/a &gt;" (1939).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does the U.S. Constitution guarantee the right to an abortion? Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth are joined by lawyer/sister Robin Linsenmayer to discuss &lt;em &gt;Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization &lt;/em &gt;(2021) and Ronald Dworkin's "Unenumerated Rights: Whether and How Roe Should be Overruled" (1992).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We previously considered &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-304-dworkin-v-74637074"&gt;Dworkin's take on what judges do when law is ambiguous &lt;/a &gt;. According to his take on abortion, which describes reasonably well the principles that underlie the dissent by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in this case, the wording in the 14th Amendment and elsewhere in the Constitution is purposefully abstract and idealistic: "Equal protection under law and "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." What is included in that big word "liberty" (and thus "protection") here can't just be what was at the moment of this amendment's ratification in 1868, but is something that society makes discoveries about as time goes on. Crucially, we've discovered it does involve a right to make person decisions about one's family, and so implies marriage equality, the right to use birth control, and the right to abortion. Without this last, according to the dissent, women are effectively denied full participation in our democracy, so abortion laws violate equal protection as well as due process.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Conservative jurisprudence does not buy any of this, and Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion denies any such reading of the 14th Amendment. The majority opinion by Samuel Alito limits itself to pointing out that abortion is different than the other rights in question (marriage equality and birth control) in that it involves another life, and so claims of liberty in the form of bodily autonomy or privacy do not apply to this. Instead, the decision countermands the highly contentious issue of how heavily to weigh the relative interests of the mother and the fetus to legislatures to decide. Alito concludes that justices in Roe v. Wade were wrong to impose their own legislative-sounding solution on this problem.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We try to figure out what all Dworkin's criteria should restrict (can states outlaw bigamy?), how freedom of religion plays into beliefs about life as it relates to abortion, what to do with frozen embryos, and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4757 &amp;amp;context=uclrev" target="_blank"&gt;Read the Dworkin article online &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the Dobbs decision online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/75143245"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on McCarthy's 1985 novel, we discuss whether the plentiful, explicit violence in the book is actually gratuitous or whether it's central for presenting the book's philosophy. What makes the book supposedly unfilmable?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then focus on the details of Judge Holden's philosophy. He posits that war is the purpose (the telos) of man. Man is essentially a game-player, and war (in the sense of small-group fighting, not national conflict) is the ultimate game, with ultimate stakes. If you win, you get to extinguish someone else's existence, and that proves your agency in the most vivid possible way. Since Holden sees war as man's destiny, we ironically gain freedom out of submitting to this destiny.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also address Holden's attempt to consume the world and whether that's actually consistent with this philosophy of war.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading the 2021 court decision &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Dobbs v.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On McCarthy's 1985 anti-Western novel, featuring Wes, Seth, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does violence play a role in the way the world works? The novel tells a historically based story of the 19th century Glanton gang who were hired as scalp hunters by the Mexican government but then went on a rogue massacre. It's told from the point of view of "The Kid," a 15-year-old member of the gang through its last stand at Yuma. It's filled with rich, often Biblical imagery and is pretty much a trippy orgy of violence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what's the philosophical interest? Well, the character of Judge Holden voices a lot of philosophy about destiny. His thesis is that the way to truly have agency in the world is through violence, not through morality (per Kant). Contra Nietzsche, the Judge does not see us as potentially transcending to a new greatness, but as on our way inexorably down. This book is a counter-narrative to American stories of Manifest Destiny that see a whole world of possibility open to our enterprising way of life. It instead seems to consider violence as inherent and central to the human condition (whether or not you as an individual may be isolated from it): The gang is opportunistic and short-sighted as it is driven (mostly) westward by its violent internal logic. The Judge sees violence as the only way to attain self-knowledge, to be truly honest with ourselves. Violence is the way that nations are established and enables bubbles of peace in which moral norms are accepted.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3AH7TCN" target="_blank"&gt;Purchase the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ronald Dworkin's "The Model of Rules" (1967) and Scott J. Shapiro's "The 'Hart-Dworkin' Debate: A Short Guide for the Perplexed" (2007).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How do judges make decisions in hard cases? When the law "runs out" and doesn't definitively decide, e.g., whether we have a general "right of privacy," do judges then just draw on their personal moral judgment in deciding cases? And if they do, can they be wrong in doing so, or is the legal system actually designed to give them that discretion?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dworkin objected to the idea that he attributed to Hart that law is all about rules. As discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-303-h-l-hart-74016573"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;, H.L.A. Hart said that law consists of primary rules for citizens' behavior and secondary rules that describe how primary rules are to be enacted and enforced, with an underlying rule of recognition that ultimately determines what the law is for a given legal system.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dworkin argued that this leaves out legal principles, which are of a different logical category than rules. Rules either apply or they don't to a given situation. If you've discovered an exception to a rule, that just means that the rule, properly written, specifies that type of exception. So "do not kill except in self-defense or a war" is a rule with some exceptions written in. Two rules in the same legal system cannot conflict; if they do, then a judge may step in and invalidate one of the rules, or modify it to remove the conflict. Legal principles, however, do often conflict, and their force remains even if in a given circumstance, the principle is outweighed by other factors. So "do not create undue burdens in voting" is one legal principle and "make sure that voting is secure" is another. When the explicit guidance of the rules of law run out, then judges instead rely on these principles, which may or may not be explicitly articulated in laws on the books, but which are also not merely the moral opinions of the judges. This idea shows, according to Dworkin, that Hart was wrong in insisting on the independence of law from morality. Legal principles contain moral content (concepts like fairness) but yet are an indispensable part of law itself and how it is interpreted by judges. These principles, as not written explicitly in law, also aren't necessarily traceable back to Hart's rule of recognition. So Dworkin's idea here amounts to a wholesale rejection of Hart's theory of the foundations of law.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This was however, just the first move in this ongoing debate, and Dworkin wrote several more articles and books elaborating his critique of Hart and his alternative explanation of judging. The responses were largely not by Hart himself (though Hart wrote something that was published posthumously as the conclusion of the latest editions of &lt;em &gt;The Concept of Law &lt;/em &gt;), but by his followers. Since we couldn't read all of this, we read the Shapiro article as a secondary source to take us through the twists and turns of the debate. In addition to the initial critique that I just described, Shapiro lays out a later critique from Dworkin's book &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3NVIafe" target="_blank"&gt;Law's Empire &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1986) that focuses on the difference in judges' decisions in hard cases as being theoretical disagreements about what law is. It's like a judge is coming up with a legal theory that is supposed to cover as much existing law and precedent as possible (just like a scientist comes up with a theory that accommodates as much of the evidence and existing theory as possible), but in both of these cases, the data underdetermines the theory, and so judges (like scientists) can have honest disagreements. Just like science is the ongoing engagement of these disagreeing voices, so law essentially includes ongoing dialogue, as various judges navigate hard cases and argue for their theories of law over time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read "&lt;a href="http://www.horty.umiacs.io/courses/readings/dworkin-1967-model-of-rules.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Model of Rules &lt;/a &gt;" and &lt;a href="https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Faculty/Shapiro_Hart_Dworkin_Debate.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the Shapiro article &lt;/a &gt;online. Most of us also at least started "&lt;a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Ronald%20Dworkin%20-%20Hard%20Cases.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Hard Cases &lt;/a &gt;," which is ch. 4 of Dworkin's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3UsG5JX" target="_blank"&gt;Taking Rights Seriously &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1977). Many of us also read an article that directly responded to Shapiro's by Brian Leiter: "&lt;a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1235 &amp;amp;context=journal_articles" target="_blank"&gt;Explaining Theoretical Disagreement &lt;/a &gt;" (2009). Dworkin's main example cases that we talk about is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riggs_v._Palmer" target="_blank"&gt;Riggs v. Palmer &lt;/a &gt;(1889). &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MfSRaXY4xh8" target="_blank"&gt;Watch the Jeffrey Kaplan video that introduced the Hart-Dworkin debate to us &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though the view Dworkin criticized was well enough conveyed by the article we read for our last episode, the view is laid out in more detail in ch. 7, "Formalism and Rule-Skepticism," of the book we read ch. 5 and 6 from, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3DZrTRY" target="_blank"&gt;The Concept of Law &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. That volume in its current edition also includes an afterward wherein Hart some time between 1986 and his death in 1992 responded in detail to Dworkin's critiques, but this proved too verbose and to on point for our purposes. (Hart mostly thought that Dworkin didn't understand him.) Dworkin got the last word in a 2017 article, "&lt;a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/2017/06/harts-posthum" target="_blank"&gt;Hart's Posthumous Reply &lt;/a &gt;."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Concept of Law &lt;/em &gt;(1961), ch. 6, "Foundations of a Legal System." This chapter goes into detail about Hart's "rule of recognition," which is what is supposed to foundationally make something legitimately a law in a given society. How can we identify something as a law? In Britain, Hart says it's when the Queen in Parliament declares something to be a law (note that I say this incorrectly as "the Queen and Parliament," which would be more ambiguous). In the U.S., the situation is more complex, as even something passed by Congress and signed by the President could be deemed not actually the law by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Even determining that the actors here are legitimate is a bit problematic, when people are challenging the legitimacy of this or that Supreme Court justice or President or member of Congress. There are laws to say what proper procedures are for obtaining that role, and legally designated officials who get to decide whether those laws have been obeyed, so the fact that there have been no judicially accepted challenges to, e.g. Neil Gorsuch's weaselly way of getting appointed means that he's legitimate, whatever the opinions of individual voters is. But despite this, there is still for Hart a question of the overall legitimacy of a government and its laws being determined by the fact that enough of the people (and in particular the judges) &lt;em &gt;accept &lt;/em &gt;its legitimacy. Even if the ultimate authority on some matter is exerted by some agency, if the consequent law is not enforced or respected by the vast majority of those affected, then it's still not a law.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So while it might seem like the chain of justification here would be one of laws the justify other laws, the bedrock of this is not, e.g. "The Constitution," i.e. a document, but the habitual obeying of (and so the interpretation of) the Constitution by a community of legal enforcers. I say "legal enforcers" instead of just "the people" because it may well be that the masses don't actually know what the Constitution says or what the chain of justification of a law amounts to, except insofar as their respect and obedience must be in some way connected to then recognizing judges and other officials (even police) as authorities whose acknowledgement of the Constitution is what matters here.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We further get into the question of how a rule of recognition might change, and what makes past legislation (e.g. signing on to the Constitution) binding on current governments. Wes mentions Noah Feldman's book, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Tahrg3" target="_blank"&gt;The Broken Constitution &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/05/12/was-emancipation-constitutional-feldman-oakes/" target="_blank"&gt;a review of it by James Oakes &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-303-h-l-hart-74016573"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

If this isn't the case, then Hart says there is no law in that society at all, whatever the government might say.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk more about what makes a legal system extant, and how laws relate to the rules of custom. Maybe some laws aren't so much invented via legislation (i.e. posited) but "found," either by a legislature trying to encode what people already do or by judges who use background mores and assumptions to figure out the spirit of the law.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about the theory that Hart argues against identifying a law as some sort of predication of how people will behave (e.g. people normally stop at red lights, therefore it's a law to do so), or what police will actually enforce, or what judges will say is the law. All of these behaviorist ways of defining law ignore what Hart calls the "internal point of view," which says that officials (at least) and citizens recognize themselves as obliged to obey law even if there's no likelihood of punishment. This is very much like how we might feel ourselves bound by rules of etiquette, and part of Hart's reason for distinguishing law from morality is because he wants to distinguish all the various ways in which norms act on us: ethically, legally, through etiquette, and sometimes just through custom, because "that's the way it's done" even though wouldn't think ourselves actually "obligated" to do it that way. Even when held at gun point one is "obliged" to obey, but that's different than being "obligated" in the sense that it's a duty to obey.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude by talking about Hart's "rule of recognition" that ultimately grounds the law for a given society; we'll talk more about this in part three, which will be released next week just for you supporters. Thanks for being a supporter!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals" (1958) and &lt;em &gt;The Concept of Law &lt;/em &gt;(1961), ch. 5 and 6.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the relationship between law and morality? If law isn't founded on morality, what is it founded on? Hart was a leading figure in the philosophy of law, and wrote in the tradition of legal positivism that goes back to the British Utilitarians John Austin and before him &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-9-utilitarian-30313318"&gt;Jeremy Bentham &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Legal positivism is a doctrine developed in opposition to natural law theory, which says that society's laws are in some way natural, that they express rights and justice as real, naturally occurring entities in the world (most likely in human nature), and that our obligation to follow law is the same as our obligation to follow other moral commands. So, for instance, a &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/tag/social-contract/" target="_blank"&gt;social contract theorist &lt;/a &gt;like Hobbes or Locke thought that societies naturally form due to the human condition, and because being in a society is better than being in a state of anarchy, we've implicitly made a commitment to obey the law which it would be immoral for us to break. Even back to Plato, we get the idea in the &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-149-platos-50939081"&gt;Crito &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;that because society has given us so much, we owe it to society to obey the law: legal duty is part of morality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A legal positivist, on the other hand, says that morality and legality are fundamentally different. Whatever one's views on morality are, and whether or not the formation of society and its laws is natural or inevitable, whatever system of laws a society devises is a contingent historical fact, and these laws may or may not be just. The fact that we can argue about whether a particular law is fair or just means that laws are not morally good just by definition, and so when judges are trying to determine how to decide some case according to the law, and thus need to figure out exactly what the law is, they should be looking at what the law says and at how judges have interpreted it in the past. They should not be looking at their own moral intuitions, on the assumption that the aim of the law is to be just and fair according to what an individual judge thinks that means. Specifically, a judge shouldn't look at a law and say, "That's unjust! Therefore it isn't really a law." It's perfectly coherent, Hart says, for a law to really be a law and yet be a terrible law.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This might seem obvious, but came up in practical terms, for instance, in considering whether law-abiding citizens under the Nazi regime could be convicted of crimes after the Nazis were defeated. If you want to punish someone who was "just following orders," then you either have to say that Nazi laws were illegitimate (not really laws), or that the post-Nazi government is allowed to retroactively call something illegal that was not in fact illegal under the Nazi regime. Hart argues that the latter strategy is the lesser of two evils, and that contorting the notion of law to implicitly include moral considerations legislators (even Nazi legislators) did not intend is unwarranted.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In each society, Hart argues, there's a foundation for law. In a simple one, the law might be just whatever the king or legislature determines it to be. In complex modern societies, there are multiple law-making entities, but also a system (the courts) that determine in case of conflicts what the law actually is. Since all laws as passed by legislatures are in general form, then it's the role of the judge to decide how such a general law applies to a specific case. If a law says "there shall be no vehicles in the park," that clearly rules out cars and means that walking is OK, but what about bikes, roller skates, mopeds, etc.? Hart calls these cases where it's not clear whether or not a law applies the &lt;em &gt;penumbra &lt;/em &gt;. In such a case, a judge might have discretion to consider that the point of the law is and so how exactly it should apply. But this extrapolation, for Hart, should again not just be a matter of the judge consulting their own moral intuitions, but instead trying to figure out the "spirit of the law." Still, this "spirit" will in some cases be merely indeterminate, and so the judge just has to make a decision and is in that sense a legislator, acting to complete a law passed by the legislature.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Now, unavoidably, figuring out the "spirit of the law," especially in the cases where the law provides the least explicit guidance, inevitably involves figuring out what the law sensibly &lt;em &gt;should &lt;/em &gt;be. So in that case, judges look to their moral intuitions. But that only works if the purposes behind those laws are good ones. A judge within the Nazi regime, trying to be faithful to its laws, will think not "is this the most humane way to interpret the law?" but "does this way of interpreting the law align with the purposes of the Fuhrer whose agents came up with it?" Does it effectively intimidate, oppress, etc.? This alone shows that morality and law are different, and so a judge doing a good professional job may be in fact furthering the ends of an evil law.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The purpose of Hart's book &lt;em &gt;The Concept of Law &lt;/em &gt;is to explain what law actually is, and he tells the story about how laws historically emerge from customs. His predecessor John Austin had (about a century earlier) described law as just being the command of a sovereign: That law is analogous to someone holding you up at gunpoint and demanding your money. It's just that the government is &lt;em &gt;always &lt;/em &gt;doing this to &lt;em &gt;all &lt;/em &gt;of us, and so we don't consider it unjust and are in the habit of obeying it. But it's really the fact that authorities will enforce a law that makes it a law.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hart disagrees, and distinguishes between primary rules that govern people's behavior directly from secondary rules that provide infrastructure to enforce primary rules. It's hard to see a law that specifies who gets to be a legislator or judge, and how long their terms will run and how much they'll get paid, as in any way like an order from a sovereign. Likewise, the laws that enable people to draw up wills and other types of contracts aren't well captured by Austin's theory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3DLXmbj" target="_blank"&gt;Purchase &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3DLXmbj" target="_blank"&gt;The Concept of Law &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://discoversocialsciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Concept-of-Law-Second-Edition.-H.L.A.-Hart.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.horty.umiacs.io/courses/readings/hart-1958-positivism-separation.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read "Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals" online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A helpful secondary source some of us looked at is Raymond Wacks' &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3fkW1ig" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy of Law: A Very Short Introduction &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and eventually Dylan recap &lt;em &gt;The Praise of Folly &lt;/em &gt;and get personal. At the end of the book, Erasmus seems to reverse himself and praises the asceticism (preference of the spiritual over the bodily) that he's been otherwise making fun of. After all, he is a Christian, so his Nietzschean critique of pretention and stolidity can't be entirely thoroughgoing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also look at the sexism in the book and how to modernize his argument that love provides a respite from the serious life. Plus, the folly of fandom and the role of humor in philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-302-erasmus-73338411"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Well, having the wisdom to avoid all trouble keeps us from getting experience that would be helpful in acting more wisely in the long run.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Erasmus (speaking with the voice of Folly) claims that foolishness in some measure is essential for getting along in the world, being creative, and performing great deeds.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;At the same time, the second part of the text is a straightforward critique of Catholic theologians: their arrogance, wealth, superficiality, theatricality, and other un-Christian characteristics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes and Nathan mention Michael Massing's &lt;em &gt;F &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3VtQB4C" target="_blank"&gt;atal Discord: Erasmus, Luther, and the Fight for the Western Mind &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Desiderius Erasmus' &lt;em &gt;The Praise of Folly &lt;/em &gt;(1509), featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Nathan Gilmour from &lt;a href="http://www.christianhumanist.org/2016/11/the-christian-humanist-podcast-episode-201-the-praise-of-folly/" target="_blank"&gt;the Christian Humanist podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does foolishness enhance life? The Dutch Renaissance Catholic theologian known for &lt;a href="https://museeprotestant.org/en/notice/luther-and-erasmus/" target="_blank"&gt;his disputes with Martin Luther &lt;/a &gt;criticized the church from the inside, using gentle satire that targeted everyone, including intellectuals like himself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The book is a piece of rhetoric, a speech purportedly delivered by the goddess Folly herself, where she points out how ubiquitous foolishness is and how it actually helps us all live better lives. So what is the actual critique? The obvious point is that we should not take ourselves too seriously, and this is grounded in an epistemic humility based on how much greater God and His Understanding are than all of us foolish mortals. Erasmus argued against the tendency of the theologians of his day (the "Schoolmen") to confidently lay out knowledge of obscure metaphysical matters, when (according to Erasmus) Jesus' apostles themselves wouldn't have been able to understand what's actually being disputed. This prefigures philosophers like Kant who argued that true metaphysical knowledge is beyond human capacities.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But Erasmus was also talking more generally about the over-emphasis on Reason among philosophers following Plato and Aristotle, who thought that contemplation is the thing that distinguishes us from animals and brings us closer to the divine. Erasmus' main target is grouchy Stoic philosophers who seek to purge our emotions and make us beings of pure Reason. This is not only impossible, but the effort saps our motivation to do anything and makes us unpleasant to be around. So devoting your life to seeking perfect reasonableness not only doesn't save one from foolishness, but it is itself very foolish.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Such a Stoic shuns, for instance, sexuality, but this is of course the source of our existence. And to engage in sexual activity involves a lot of foolish behavior, both in the animality of the act itself and in all the romantic gestures that lead up to it and the compromises involved in being in a marriage. Erasmus was extremely sexist, and pretty much thought that all women were inherently silly, but that this was a blessing for men to be around, a welcome relief from all that serious men's work of various sorts. Likewise, Erasmus points at the foolishness of childhood and the relief that old age provides in making us childlike once again.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This could just be an Aristotelian kind of critique of excess. Of course Erasmus actually thinks reason and control of one's urges is good, just we need moderation to be well-rounded and healthy. It's also a proto-Nietzschean critique of the excessive will to truth. Erasmus says that flattery, including flattery of ourselves, is despite being false typically necessary to live with harmony and enough self-esteem to get out and accomplish things in the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ekUloA" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the translation by Radice that we read &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30201/30201-h/30201-h.htm" target="_blank"&gt;read some version online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan explore the question, "Is it necessary for us to have representatives of an affected group with us as guests when we talk about an issue in philosophy that affects that group?" This specifically grew out of our abortion episode, for which we planned to have a female guest, but that fell through, and we (without hesitation) recorded it anyway. Was part three with Jenny really more illuminating for you than the earlier parts due to that female presence?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get into the wider issues of representation in philosophy and in the culture in general. Is Wes right that our listeners mostly don't care about these things, or is Mark right that in 2022 including such representation is optically if not intellectually essential? Or do you feel that none of our positions on this really "get it," given that we're middle aged white guys who like to think in the abstract?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our next episode is on Erasmus, a Christian Humanist, and this will feature a real-life current Christian Humanist thinker as a guest with us. We typically do not make a point in having Christians on with us when we're considering (and often very critical of) Christian thinkers, nor do we have a right-winger with us when considering a conservative like Scruton (unless you count Wes, which you should not). Should we? In some cases (e.g. Ayn Rand and libertarianism), we make a positive point of &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;having a partisan of the view on with us, as the fractiousness would be a distraction from our goals.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We do typically (but not always) have an African-American on with us when talking about race, and a woman on with us when doing feminism. Do you think that's needed? Should we always have a Chinese speaker when talking about Chinese philosophy and and someone Indian when talking about Indian philosophers? If so, is that merely because of the scholarship (like it's good that Dylan and Wes have some background reading ancient Greek when we talk about Plato), or because of the cultural identity issues? Feel free to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/contact-pel/" target="_blank"&gt;contact us &lt;/a &gt;with your thoughts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/people/dr-jennifer-l-hansen" target="_blank"&gt;Jenny Hansen &lt;/a &gt;joins us for our final part of this discussion, covering "&lt;a href="https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil215/Warren.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion &lt;/a &gt;" by Mary Anne Warren (1973) and returning in parts to "&lt;a href="http://www.jus.unitn.it/users/casonato/biodiritto/slides/Thomson%20article_mod.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;A Defense of Abortion &lt;/a &gt;" (1971) by Judith Jarvis Thomson to allow Jenny to weigh in on the points we made in parts &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-301-is-part-72490632"&gt;one &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-301-is-part-72490623"&gt;two &lt;/a &gt;. She also talks a bit about the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey" target="_blank"&gt;Planned Parenthood v. Casey &lt;/a &gt;1992 case that changed the framework for viability from Roe and established that states can only regulate abortion to the extent that it doesn't place an "undue burden" on women seeking abortions. (According to Jenny, this actually created &lt;em &gt;more &lt;/em &gt;potential burdens for pregnant women.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Warren focuses on the moral personhood of the fetus (as opposed to being merely genetically human, which purportedly a lump of cancer cells are too, and we don't consider that worth protecting). She defines moral personhood using a set of psychological criteria: We value people because of their consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity, capacity to communicate, and self-awareness. Now, there may be borderline cases where someone doesn't have all of these, and we may argue about whether these cases count, but Warren claims that a fetus has zero of these, and so is clearly not a person, and so not worthy of moral protection.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Warren claims (in a 1982 postscript) that newborns lack personhood too, but it's still always wrong to kill them in this age where if the mother doesn't want a newborn, someone else will. So newborns are, on Warren's view, not persons, but morally protected anyway. This might make us question whether personhood really is the primary criteria for moral protection. Certainly a being a full person is sufficient for protection, but is it necessary? Moral personhood is as much about agency as anything else; it's not about who's worthy of moral protection, but of why we hold responsible morally for their actions. Those are the members of our moral community, in the sense that we are all the group who might be conceived as having assented to a universal social contract. We're the ones bound by Kantian self-regulation considerations and/or who are negotiators (a la Habermas) about what moral rules we all should collectively follow. To be a person is to be a moral agent, but is our agency really our source of moral value, such that infants who lack agency are only valuable due to their relation to agents, or are infants in fact the paradigm case of valuable human life in a way that this personhood argument (and also, really, Marquis' argument about "having a future like ours") fails to account for?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Jenny describes personhood as relevant to many other current moral issues, such as immigration. For more on this, listen go &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-236-judith-of-34326434"&gt;our interview with Judith Butler about "grievable lives."&lt;/a &gt;These other cases are not particularly salient to Warren's personhood discussion, because refugees and such, as humans over the age of one, have all the personhood criteria, so the issue is not whether they should be classified as persons, but whether now that we've (of course) classified them this way, we actually live up to the moral responsibilities that entails. This actually gets us more into Thomson's area about what positive duties we have to help people in need.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're adding a third week of release to this episode, both because we really needed this third part to get through the readings we selected, but moreso because Jenny had COVID and missed our initial discussion (parts one and two), and we didn't want to just put her participation behind our paywall. You supporters get an extended version of this episode, as Jenny weighed in at the end on our whole "is it necessary for us to have representative of X group on an episode relevant to that group?" question at the end of this. On the next Nightcap, you'll also hear us hosts systematically explore this issue.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Of course in this episode, even though we've now gotten some female representation here, we don't have any Catholic or otherwise anti-abortion representation among our panelists. For you pro-life listeners, does that make this whole three-part episode biased or otherwise unhelpful? Is it sufficient for us to merely report the arguments of people like Marquis (and should we have spent more time on Noonan?), or do we (by your judgment) actually need more of a debate format with one party who holds the "conservative" view here?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Next time: Erasmus' &lt;em &gt;The Praise of Folly &lt;/em &gt;(1511).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We continue from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/72490632"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on Judith Jarvis Thomson's "&lt;a href="http://www.jus.unitn.it/users/casonato/biodiritto/slides/Thomson%20article_mod.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;A Defense of Abortion &lt;/a &gt;" (1971), and then add Don Marquis' "&lt;a href="http://faculty.polytechnic.org/gfeldmeth/45.marquis.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Why Abortion is Immoral &lt;/a &gt;" (1989) and we begin our treatment of Mary Anne Warren's "&lt;a href="https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil215/Warren.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion &lt;/a &gt;" (1973), which we'll conclude in part three of this discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We pry further into Thomson's distinction between the "indecent" and the "unjust." According to Thomson, some actions which are not strictly morally required are nonetheless to be highly encouraged, and failing to do them is still morally objectionable in some lesser way. Thomson refers to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" target="_blank"&gt;Kitty Genovese &lt;/a &gt;case where many people purportedly heard a murder happening but no one intervened or even called the police. So while Thomson thinks that a woman has the absolute right to abort even the most advanced fetus for even a trivial reason such as not wanting to reschedule a planned vacation trip, this is still morally offensive.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So when a sacrifice is small, we should surely make it, but when does a burden become too much, and in the case of pregnancy and birth, which have such drastic effects on a woman's body and experience, does the sacrifice involved always outweigh any rights of the fetus qua full person (which, remember, Thomson is granting for the purposes of her argument, though she ultimately doesn't believe that the fetus is at all stages of development a person; she thinks we can set aside that intractable problem)?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Marquis' argument against abortion begins by considering why we consider it wrong to kill an adult, and he says it's because we're depriving that person of a future. And it's not just any future, but a "future like ours," which is deliberately left as a vague appeal to our intuitions, but it's supposed to be different than the future of an animal (at least most animals), and so has something to do with our ability to experience reflectively. So this is supposed to &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;be just another appeal to current "personhood," which Marquis agrees with Thomson is a problematic concept that philosophers will likely not agree on. And it definitely is not supposed to add the even more difficult concept of "potential," as in "this fetus is right now a potential person." Instead, a genetically human fetus, and even a zygote immediately at the point of conception, is a being, right now, that has a human future (as far as we are aware; it could of course miscarry, but likewise any adult human right now could die naturally tomorrow, but that doesn't give us a reason for regarding them now as having future like ours). It's unclear whether this emphasis on the human future is quantitative, which would mean that the lives of the young are more valuable than the old, because they have more future ahead of them. However, that is one of our moral intuitions that would support this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Contrariwise, Warren's focus is on the current status of a creature, and whether it has those psychological characteristics that we morally value. To be a full person is to be a full member of the moral community, and that involves not only feeling and reflection but the ability to make choices, to move and otherwise act in a self-directed way, and to communicate, which is arguably essential to reasoning. This is what Kant means by a person being "an end in itself," and so a source (really, the only source, for Kant) of moral value. So for instance, for Kant, animals don't have moral value in themselves. We shouldn't be cruel to animals only because of what that would do to us, the actors: Getting in the habit of ignoring animal pain would get us in the habit of ignoring human pain.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Now, Warren needn't toe the full Kantian line and say that there's no value in anything not fully a person (animals and other natural products, and even artworks and other artifacts) may have moral value as well, just not as much. For Warren, it's only necessary that these lesser values be overruled by the mother's interests and rights as a full person. So Warren also doesn't want to wade into the metaphysical thicket of the exact value of "potential personhood," except insofar as whatever that is, it's obviously less than full personhood.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The big problem for Warren's argument, which she addresses in a 1982 addendum to the paper, is infanticide. An infant clearly does not have any more ability to reflect, communicate, and reason than a late-term fetus does. We do not hold an infant morally responsible for its actions. So according to Warren's argument, the value of an infant must be conferred by the parents: They want it. If there's truly an infant unwanted by anyone (such as in starvation-level ancient societies that might set out infants to die in the cold), then it's not wrong to kill it. We merely feel, sentimentally, that it is wrong, but rationally (again, think of Kant here), it's not. I'd feel terrible if you murdered my pets, and so there should definitely be laws against that, but in killing my pets you've harmed me, not so much the pets. And of course pets have much more self-awareness than a newborn, so the argument should apply even more to them. If you're interested in this strange argument, see &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2Qfiq18DMYk" target="_blank"&gt;Don Marquis debating Peter Singer &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;At one point I bring up &lt;a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/questions/HNhKDNEJ/the_euthyphro_fallacy.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Euthyphro Fallacy &lt;/a &gt;, which is more general than the discussion of theism in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-46-plato-on-15467712" target="_blank"&gt;Plato's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-46-plato-on-15467712" target="_blank"&gt;Euthyphro &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. The question for Marquis is, why is our future valuable? Is it only valuable if the individual whose future it is finds it valuable, so suicide should be OK? Or we could admit that someone contemplating suicide isn't a prototypical example of a clear thinker, so you could add the caveat that the suicidal person, if they could just get past this suicidal time in their lives, &lt;em &gt;would &lt;/em &gt;value that future? Or instead, is the future intrinsically valuable (to creatures like us), and that's why we value it and consider it rational and worthy of social support to do so? Marquis, like Plato, says it's the latter, whereas a social constructionist like Hume or Habermas would argue that all statements of value must ultimately be based on what people actually want.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Actually, Marquis by appealing to our intuitions is trying to bypass these metaphysical issues about the foundations of morality, and Thomson and Warren do the same in different ways, but is that really possible? If we're going to really figure out this intractable social dilemma, don't we have to adopt a metaphysics? At least Catholic absolutists are transparent about this: Theologians back to at least &lt;a href="https://www.catholic.com/qa/did-st-thomas-aquinas-believe-ensoulment-occurred-40-or-80-days-after-conception-making-abortion" target="_blank"&gt;Aquinas &lt;/a &gt;have theorized about "ensoulment" happening at some time or other during pregnancy, and that's the point where it becomes a person. A secular, materialist metaphysics has no such resources available to it, and so will need to fully grapple with the question of where moral value comes from: Is it human nature (telos), human preferences, or what? Is "personhood" a natural category or just a social construction, and if it's the latter, why would we possibly think that this concept that we've developed to deal with humans in the world (adults and newborns alike) would give us a clear verdict on the status of a fetus or embryo or zygote?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss some widely read papers about the morality of abortion, starting here with a selection from the Roe v. Wade decision (1973) and Judith Jarvis Thomson's "&lt;a href="http://www.jus.unitn.it/users/casonato/biodiritto/slides/Thomson%20article_mod.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;A Defense of Abortion &lt;/a &gt;" (1971). Featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Roe tried to sidestep the philosophical question of the current personhood of a fetus but did assert that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting potential human life, to be weighed against the right of privacy and the state's interest in protecting the health of the mother. At the time, only a first trimester abortion was deemed definitely safer than carrying the birth to term, so before that point, the latter interest had no effect. But after that point, the state (said the decision) has the option to regulate abortions. Also per the state of medical science at the time, six months was the time that the fetus was determined to be viable, and so at that point and no earlier could states have the option of restricting abortion altogether; it would be up to the state at that time to determine to what degree the interest in protecting potential human life outweighs the right of privacy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the decision was flawed not because of its outcome (protecting abortion rights) or because of a shaky constitutional foundation (is the right of privacy really implicitly in the Constitution?), but because it cast into permanent law the momentary state of science at the time. Premature babies are born and survive much earlier than six months now, undermining the dividing point between second and third trimester that the decision had said marked the difference between the state being able to merely regulate vs. outright prohibit. So by their original logic, the state should now be able to intervene much earlier. However, late-term abortions are now much safer, undermining the distinction the court drew between first and second trimester regarding the mother's health. So by their original logic, the state should not be allowed to intervene at all much later than three months. When these two points actually cross, e.g. let's say at six months an abortion is now much safer than carrying to term, while viability now comes before that, the logic of the decision completely implodes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The case did not itself weigh in on the morality of abortion, just with who gets to decide on its morality: Is it a decision for mother and doctor (as the court says), or for the state? This is interesting to philosophy as a matter of the relation between morality and legality, but the fundamental moral question remains: Is abortion morally OK, and does this change based on the fetus' stage of development? Most arguments about abortion (including the paper we'll discuss in part three of this episode by Mary Anne Warren) are about whether a fetus at X months should be considered a "person," i.e. a member of the moral community, such that killing it would be murder.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thomson sidesteps that issue entirely by arguing that even if a fetus is a person, it's still permissible for the mother to abort it, because it's relying on her body to survive, which is hers and so within the sphere of her moral decision-making. She argues this through a series of analogies, the main one being that if you woke up surgically attached to another adult and told that if you didn't stay attached to them for nine months, they'd die. Thomson says that in such a case you certainly have the right to detach. It's your body, your time, your autonomy, and you have the right to defend those things, even at the cost of someone else's life. While it might be morally admirable for you to make sacrifices to keep the person alive, the decision is ultimately up to you, and it's definitely permissible for you to say no.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So Thomson reframes abortion as a Good Samaritan situation. Are we morally required to make sacrifices for others? Even if the fetus is a full person, is the mother morally required to make the sacrifices involved in giving birth? Thomson says no, even though that kills the fetus.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In parts &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/72490623" target="_blank"&gt;two &lt;/a &gt;and three of this episode (with part three featuring returning guest Jenny Hansen, who was supposed to join us for this first discussion but got COVID), we'll discuss "&lt;a href="http://faculty.polytechnic.org/gfeldmeth/45.marquis.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Why Abortion is Immoral &lt;/a &gt;" by Don Marquis (1989) and "&lt;a href="https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil215/Warren.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion &lt;/a &gt;" by Mary Anne Warren (1973). I also refer in this discussion to an optional paper, "An Almost Absolute Value in History" by John T. Noonan (1970). We also did record a Nightcap where we debated the issue of representation as it applies to this podcast: Is it "absurd" for us to deal with this issue that so affects women's bodies without having a woman as part of the conversation? You'll get to hear that in about two weeks.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;All of these papers, including the Roe v. Wade abridgement that we used, can be found in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3f5i5Nh" target="_blank"&gt;Contemporary Moral Problems &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, ed. James E. White. I think we're interested in taking on more of these problems in future episodes, so you might want to pick it up. You can readily find the individual articles online too; &lt;a href="https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil215/Thomson.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here's Thomson's &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I also refer to podcasts on this, first by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/c6f0Ewu6ky4" target="_blank"&gt;Angela Knobel of the Thomistic Institute &lt;/a &gt;, then by &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ethics-of-abortion/id1548604447?i=1000562784585" target="_blank"&gt;Kate Greasley on The Ezra Klein Show &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-300-nietzsche-71787631"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life” (1874), we get into the antiquarian use of history and the critical approach to history and Nietzsche's humanistic goals in his essay.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One surprising notion that Nietzsche throws in is that even though we have described him in the past as a defender of human instincts, here he describes our human nature as something culturally acquired. When we criticize history, we're trying to create a "second nature" in ourselves, to create new habits instead of just following tradition. Nietzsche tells us that even though this is difficult, all "first natures" (what we take to be natural and instinctual) were always second natures to start with. Trying to "get back to nature" can't just mean throwing off old strictures, because then you'll just be aimless and lazy. It needs to be an act of creation. This clearly reflects Nietzsche's concern in his later writings that, for instance, in throwing off traditional religion (which of course we should do), we might then become nihilists, believing in (and motivated by) nothing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another point made is that history is necessarily constructionist to some degree. One can reinterpret history so as to be inspired by different events. But figuring out the limits of this is interesting: Just as you can't arbitrarily create values to declare various things great according to your whims, you can't just arbitrarily declare that what was considered great is now mundane and vice versa. Part of Nietzsche's project to help us reinvent ourselves is to reinvent how we take history as the foundation of ourselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The two "solutions" Nietzsche provides (well, refers to; there's not much explanation of how these would work in practice) are being "unhistorical," which means just being in the moment and not so self-conscious about one's relation to history; and being "suprahistorical," which is seeing through history to find perennial truths.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The second half of this part of the discussion is devoted to answering audience questions, both about this reading and more generally. We compare Nietzsche to Heidegger (note that Heidegger taught a semester-length course on this essay!), think about what Nietzsche would say about social justice critiques of history. We try to recall our past treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-102-emerson-33200505"&gt;Emerson &lt;/a &gt;. Do we look like what you expected us to look like? Should we do more of these videos.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though you're not now in the live audience, you can still be a part of the conversation by commenting on this post or on the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i5owZnjblT4" target="_blank"&gt;live video &lt;/a &gt;, which we'll consult for a future Nightcap recording.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this special &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i5owZnjblT4" target="_blank"&gt;live-streamed show &lt;/a &gt;, we discuss Friedrich Nietzsche's “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life” (1874), which is &lt;em &gt;Untimely Meditations &lt;/em &gt;#2, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the healthiest way to relate to our history? More generally, should we live lives driven purely by reason, which includes a mature awareness of as much of our culture's intellectual history as possible? Or is it in fact necessary in order to do anything great to willfully ignore most of what came before?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nietzsche of course doesn't want us to be ignorant of history, but he's against what was considered a "scientific" take on history in his time, which (influenced by &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-15-hegel-on-30313561"&gt;Hegel &lt;/a &gt;) is a matter of seeing history as great forces pushing history forward. This leads to seeing oneself in the present as merely a cog in a historical machine with no free will and no real power to affect things. Whether or not it's true, action requires that we believe that we are free and efficacious.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nietzsche identifies three approaches to history which are all useful in their place but oppressive if one pursues them too consistently:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Monumental history &lt;/strong &gt;recognizes the actions of great individuals in the past. This can inspire us to great things or it can weigh us down by taking that greatness as something that we in the present can never live up to and must just bow down before.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Antiquarian history &lt;/strong &gt;is scholarly history as you'd ordinarily think of it: Taking a keen interest in the past qua past. This roots us to our homeland and so gives our lives situatedness and meaning, but it also tends to make us too focused on the history of our little piece of ground and too uncritical and equalizing about all aspects of that history. We might pursue tradition for tradition's sake, which again, devalues our capabilities in the present. Everything new is dismissed as a deviation from the past.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Critical history &lt;/strong &gt;unlike the other two types allows us to cast judgment on history, which for Nietzsche is good, as he is a big proponent of having the courage to be a judge. There are always errors in the past which we can see and (try to) learn not to repeat. However, we can see how being too critical throws out the baby with the bathwater. To modernize the lesson: Yes, Aristotle and Kant were racist, but does that mean that we shouldn't read them?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;We need all of these types, and you'll hear about all of them if after listening to this you proceed to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/71787618" target="_blank"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3QNnKVH" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3QNnKVH" target="_blank"&gt;Untimely Meditations &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEENietzscheAbuseTableAll.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read this essay online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;It's a different sort of Nightcap to fill supporters' nights since the publication of ep. 300 got delayed by a week. (Note that you &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i5owZnjblT4" target="_blank"&gt;can watch it unedited &lt;/a &gt;if you're impatient.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our audio editor &lt;a href="https://www.pixelboxmediagroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tyler Hislop &lt;/a &gt;, probably the only human being who listens to every one of Mark's four podcasts, joins Mark to talk through his impressions of the evolving PEL, representation, our first year of &lt;a href="https://philosophyimprov.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy vs. Improv &lt;/a &gt;, season two that just wrapped up of &lt;a href="https://prettymuchpop.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Pretty Much Pop: A Culture Podcast &lt;/a &gt;, and the last year (really, much more) of &lt;a href="https://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"FY," for those of you not in the business world, stands for "fiscal year," which span is a year long and whose exact dimensions depend on the idiosyncrasies of the organization, though it's often July-June. In this case we're considering the beginning of the school year to be the end of FY2022 and the beginning of FY2023. Just so ya know.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan conclude our discussion of Shakespeare's play. We talk about the exchanges about art in the play: How does art relate to life and to commerce?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This leads us to consider more generally Shakespeare's language and how we moderns can be good spectators of these plays. Are we meant to just get the gist, or is study and preparation necessary before experiencing one of these plays? Is it OK to modernize the language at all so that today's audiences will understand?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the version of the play we used, there are notes not only to explain the more difficult language but also notes about the stage directions and variations used for a few different prominent performances of the play, so we talk about ways people have used this to help the play connect with audiences.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-299-in-timon-70854273"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Then we move to explicitly considering the Cynic school the historical figure of Diogenes. Is Timon really a Cynic?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For a nice, concise overview of Cynicism, try &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/cynics" target="_blank"&gt;the History of Philosophy podcast &lt;/a &gt;. Some of us also looked at the book &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Cf1NuU" target="_blank"&gt;Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360001093_Diogenes's_Sayings_and_Anecdotes_With_Other_Popular_Moralists_An_Introduction_to_Cynicism_and_Cynic_philosophy" target="_blank"&gt;here's an online version &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then discuss the underdeveloped B-plot about the general Alcibiades and the multiple epitaphs for Timon, as well as other issues regarding the numerous minor characters.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we consider the potential feminist angle on the play, per Jonathan's claim that this is a picture of a world without women. This is elaborated (says Wes) in an essay we did not read called &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/5453595/Timon_of_Athens_The_Rage_of_Disillusion" target="_blank"&gt;"Timon of Athens: The Rage of Disillusion" by Susan Handelman &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What role does money have in human psychology? This is one of several philosophical questions that William Shakespeare's least popular play explores, and Mark, Wes, and Dylan start off our rumination on these with special guest Sir Jonathan Bate, editor of this new complete edition of Shakespeare's plays for the Royal Shakespeare Company, who played Flavius in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/shakespeares-of-70200820" target="_blank"&gt;audioplay &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We consider what exactly is wrong with Timon's way of dealing generously with society. This seems like a virtue, but yet it not only sets him up for disappointment, but may in itself be a transactional, power-grabbing, hyper-conventional way of dealing with others that rules out true friendship. Then what about his "break" that divides the two halves of the play? What could possibly explain this? We discuss Timon's conversations with Flavius the loyal steward, Apemantus the cynic, and the bandits to try to figure out what broken Timon's philosophy actually is.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2022/08/19/ep299-2-shakespeares-timon-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;p &lt;/a &gt;art two, Sarah Manton will instead be our guest (also with Seth returning) to talk about Diogenes the Cynic, the Alcibiades plot, and Timon as "a world without women." Then in the supporter-only part three, we'll talk about what Shakespeare seems to be saying about art and how to be a Shakespeare consumer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark Linsenmayer reads the 1905 article, which serves to supplement our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-34-frege-on-15462540" target="_blank"&gt;Frege &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-38-bertrand-15462639" target="_blank"&gt;Russell &lt;/a &gt;episodes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Frege, a word can have both a meaning (its sense) and a denotation (its referent). So "Clark Kent" and "Superman" have the same referent, but different senses. But since actually, Superman is a fictional character, technically speaking, neither of those terms has a referent, so in that case, to avoid the term being meaningless, Frege says that the referent IS the sense.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This means that the sense, the linguistic meaning, has to be part of your ontology, your list of things that exist in the world. For a natural science-minded person like Quine, this is intolerable: meanings aren't the kind of things that science studies. So he embraced Russell's solution, which it to analyze a statement like "Superman wears a cape" as "There is some X such that X has super strength, wears an "S," is also known as "Clark Kent," etc., and that X wears a cape." This way, the sentence is still meaningful; it just happens to be false, because there is no X that fulfills this description.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Meanwhile, Socrates' former admirer Alcibiades has been exiled and is coming back to make war on the city! Will Athens survive? What do these plots have to do with each other?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;The PEL Players are back, with more players than ever, doing an unrehearsed reading of William Shakespeare's least popular play, co-written with Thomas Middleton in Shakespeare's later years, probably around 1605.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The play is about money and cynicism, where a man gets to see where his friends go when his money runs out and let's say &lt;em &gt;doesn't react well &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is our largest cast ever, with the highly experienced Shakespearean actor &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_O._Sanders" target="_blank"&gt;Jay &lt;/a &gt;playing Timon, comedy legend &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ian_Black" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Ian Black &lt;/a &gt;as the cynic philosopher Apemantus, TV and film actor &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3166276/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Tow &lt;/a &gt;as the Athenian general Alcibiades (all grown up and away from the teachings and temptation of that gorgeous Socrates), and Sir Jonathan Bate of Oxford and Arizona State, the co-editor of the brand new, second edition of the Royal Shakespeare Company's &lt;em &gt;Shakespeare's Complete Works &lt;/em &gt;, which was the impetus and source for this performance (he'll be joining us for ep. 299 to discuss the play).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There are over 30 distinct speaking roles in the play, so the Michaels both also have small parts, as do the rest of us: returning stalwart (and let's say assistant casting director for this production) &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/?s=youmans" target="_blank"&gt;Bill Youmans &lt;/a &gt;, theater actor &lt;a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Sarah-Manton/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Manton &lt;/a &gt;(Bill and Sarah play the main lords who take advantage of Timon's parties, among other parts), the writer (and frequent Pretty Much Pop guest) &lt;a href="https://prettymuchpop.com/?s=bruck" target="_blank"&gt;Sarahlyn Bruck &lt;/a &gt;(who plays another lord, a messenger, and more).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plus, the reading includes all four of us podcasters: Mark Linsenmayer (who directed and edited this thing, reads the stage directions, and plays the Poet, the Fool, and Cupid), Seth Paskin (who plays the Painter and Timon's servant Flaminius), Wes Alwan (who plays the Merchant, Timon's servant Servilius, and along with Sarahlyn plays an Athenian senator), and Dylan Casey (who plays the Jeweler and among other parts another, unnamed servant of Timon whom we've decided to call Snivilius).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The music is by &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/?s=segel" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Segel &lt;/a &gt;. You should check out &lt;a href="https://music.jsegel.com/album/superfluity" target="_blank"&gt;his Bandcamp page &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The play is three hours long, so we decided to split it into the two halves identified by Jonathan Bate. This recording includes acts 1-3, while part two includes the remaining acts 4 and 5. Plus we do some chatting between some scenes, with reflections at the end of the whole production.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why is the play unpopular? Well, the structure is pretty goofy, with some underdeveloped plot points and some that are stretched out to the point of redundancy. Still, it's got some interesting ideas in it about how one's philosophy might change with circumstance, how money corrodes (or replaces?) social relations, plus some reflections on generosity, friendship, justice, duty, the arts, and party pranks.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3SyIAtE" target="_blank"&gt;Buy Timon edited by Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/downloads/pdf/timon-of-athens_PDF_FolgerShakespeare.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read a version of the play online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/partiallyexaminedlife/posts?filters%5Btag%5D=audioplay" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to more PEL Audioplays &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Picture by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On 7/11/22, Mark and Wes first discuss a few more passages from Ficino's &lt;em &gt;Commentary on Plato's Symposium on Love &lt;/em &gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-298-marsilio-69472045"&gt;listen to the episode first &lt;/a &gt;), including one on five types of desire: How the two most extreme ones are "daemons," i.e. primal urges (one towards procreation, one towards God), and in the incarnation of these in human psychology, we have to have a desire that's a compromise between the two: moral/social, i.e. friendship. Then there's a compromise (a half-way point) between this median and each of the extremes, which are the practical implementations of the extreme desires. In sum, we get a picture of Ficino's psychology that's not that different in its explanatory character from, e.g. Indian psychology with its "gunas" and "poisons" and such.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then look further at Ficino's picture of love as a type of death and rebirth in the other, and then at his physical/physiological explanation of love as a communicable disease, where "missiles of spirit" come out of our eyes and pierce others' hearts. Yes, this is very weird. Plus, how does Ficino's idea of love as love of God match Kierkegaard's religious take on love?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally we turn to PEL Live, our upcoming play reading featuring Michael Ian Black and the philosophy of cynicism, follow-up re. the close reading process, Zizek, Sam Harris, why Wes doesn't want to be a political influencer, Coleman Hughes, Russell Brand. Plus, &lt;a href="https://chartable.com/charts/itunes/us-philosophy-podcasts" target="_blank"&gt;the philosophy podcast ratings charts &lt;/a &gt;that we used to be consistently like #7 on for years but now thanks to new entries and some reorganization of podcasts by Apple, we're lucky to be in the top 20.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Peter gives us some context in terms of other Renaissance theories of love, and then we're back to the text, considering the role of beauty in the theory and how this connects to our recent coverage of various thinkers on aesthetics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also fill out Ficino's neo-Platonic epistemology: How knowledge works given his multi-layered metaphysics whereby it's not just that there's a world of the Forms that somehow imprints matter, but there are these intermediate entities.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We wrap up by talking to Peter a bit more about covering A-lister vs. less famous philosophers, and how to rate fame and influence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next Time: &lt;/strong &gt;We're reading Shakespeare's play &lt;em &gt;Timon of Athens &lt;/em &gt;with help from some TV actors.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Commentary on Plato's Symposium on Love &lt;/em &gt;(1475), with guest Peter Adamson from the &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/" target="_blank"&gt;History of Philosophy podcast &lt;/a &gt;joining Mark, Wes, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;&lt;em &gt;Attention: &lt;/em &gt;&lt;/strong &gt;&lt;em &gt;We'll be live-streaming video for our big ep. 300 on Friday, Aug. 19 at 8pm ET. More info at &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/pel-live/" target="_blank"&gt;partiallyexaminedlife.com/pel-live &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;.&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Leading up to that episode, we're continuing to revisit some classic themes, and this constitutes our reacquaintance with Plato's &lt;em &gt;Symposium &lt;/em &gt;(covered in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-100-platos-33200350"&gt;our live ep. 100 &lt;/a &gt;), albeit through the lens of the Renaissance effort to combine Platonism with Christianity. Whereas the multiple speakers in Plato's work present apparently contrasting views of love, with Socrates' view at the end intended to show how the previous ones were inadequate, Ficino instead treats all the speeches as expressing truths about love when reinterpreted through his neo-Platonic metaphysics and ethics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For instance, Aristophanes' famous myth in Plato's book whereby each of us is half a creature in search of completion is replaced in Ficino's theology with the idea that we've all lost our native "supernatural light" that would allow us to behold perfection (a la getting out of the cave in Plato's &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;), and we all seek, with the "natural light" that we do all retain (i.e. attraction toward beauty, which is Ficino's definition for love) to recover that supernatural light and so recover (ultimately) God.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ficino shows us a full-blown metaphysics complete with an "Angelic Mind" (where the Forms live; they can't live in God because God is absolutely unitary and simple and so can't have multiple Forms as parts), the "World Soul" (which is what moves the heavens; unlike the Angelic Mind, it exists within time), and "World Body" (nature itself, which is organized by reflections of the Forms from the preceding, higher entities: pretty much Forms as Aristotle conceived them; Peter refers to this at one point as "quality," drawing on elsewhere in Ficino's writings), and only then the individual bodies we interact with. Love ends up being a primary metaphysical force both in creation down these layers (God created the world out of an act of free love and essentially shares the Forms with us out of love) and (more importantly for our values and behavior, love is all about our turning back to divine sources. As with Plato's picture (via Socrates, relaying teachings he says he received from a teacher named Diotima), love for Ficino is all about climbing the metaphysical ladder to become more spiritual.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He wants to argue that even though the desire for generation (reproduction) is natural, and so is a natural part of love, we're not actually, when we find someone attractive, attracted to their body. Again, love (attraction) is a matter of seeking beauty, and beauty for Ficino is a matter of harmony of elements. This is something that only the mind and also our senses of sight and hearing can appreciate. Our other senses (importantly touch) are not such that they can distinguish a harmonized blend. So appreciating someone's physical beauty is a matter of appreciating their appearance: an arrangement of elements, i.e. a form, not the matter itself, and what we really want is to stand in the presence of that beauty and contemplate it. Wanting to actually touch (and further, have sex with) the person is no part of love, according to Ficino. Ficino is the one who really invented the term "Platonic love" in its modern sense as love without sex. He was reacting to the religious philosophers of his time who wanted to cancel Plato as a dirty, sex-obsessed pervert.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Like many Christian apologists, Ficino was trying to account for something he sees as bad (sex) not because God is bad, but because we've been given (indirectly from God via various daemons, just like Socrates' daemon that he said in the &lt;em &gt;Apology &lt;/em &gt;forced him to do philosophy) various legitimate urges which very well might (and for Ficino, most often do) fall out of balance. We all have two eternal types of love (primal drives) within us, one of which pulls us up the ladder towards God via contemplation, the other of which pulls us down towards the beasts via fornication. In both cases, what we want is (per Socrates' definition) self-reproduction in the presence of beauty, but the beasts want this very literally, while reasoning, spiritual humans want instead to reproduce the Forms, including spreading ideas of virtue through philosophical conversations and educating others. By making these distinctions, Ficino can argue that we're all equipped with divine capabilities while also saying that we are for the most part fallen, and that it's only rare, wise individuals that can lift their eyes from the physical and recover the perfection that is our birthright.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our dual fallen/blessed nature correspondingly gives rise to a puzzle (or maybe just an inconsistency in Ficino's ideas arising from disagreements among the speakers in Plato's &lt;em &gt;Symposium &lt;/em &gt;) about love: If love is desire, then love is a lack, and so not in itself a perfection. So God's "loving" (out of fullness) couldn't be the same thing as our loving (out of desire for that fullness), though the two are obviously related. Even sticking to the earthly realm, there's love as in unrequited desire but then also fulfilled desire. At one point Plato says that in the latter case, the love is really the desire for the &lt;em &gt;continued &lt;/em &gt;presence of the beloved (since the lover already has the beloved for the moment). This makes it sound like love is actually always in vain: a desire for eternity that we can never have, a desire for a full merging of two people that is impossible, a desire that always transcends the feeling of the moment. While we've discussed thinkers who've toyed with the idea that on these grounds, love is pathological (see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-283-alain-on-59547537"&gt;our most recent treatment of this in Badiou &lt;/a &gt;), for Ficino, it just means that love can't literally be for the other person, but is really for the divine, which is the only thing that is permanent, and our spiritual connection with it is the only way we can relate in a permanent, ultimately fulfilled way to anything.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3PNFzn4" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding our close reading for the moment of Heidegger's &lt;em &gt;Being and Time &lt;/em &gt;, now up to chapter 3, sections 15 and 16.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These sections are entirely focused on H's primordial ontological category of Being: "ready to hand," or equipment. Since we are primarily action-oriented beings, then (as discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-297-heidegger-69019358"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;), the world is not a set of present-at-hand objects all laid out before us (as H. alleges that Aristotle and science and everyone else has always thought), but is a background "world" in which we act. But this world is not just an undifferentiated mass either; it's made up of tools, like even our own body, which we don't "encounter" (i.e. focus on as a distinct object that needs to be explicitly understood) unless something goes wrong with them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/69019342"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;Being and Time &lt;/em &gt;, now up to Ch. 2, sec. 12 on what our "being-in-the-world" amounts to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to H, we are not in the world like a shoe is in a shoebox. Rather, the world is part of our existential structure, providing a background for our actions. Our primary relation to it is not knowing, as if we were a subject beholding a painting, but more like (just to carry forward this metaphor) always already being in the painting.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The main question of the section is "what is it for an object to become encounterable to us?" Given that we're already immersed in the world, for something to actually become a focus for us is nothing like what it's like for two physical objects to bump into each other. Strictly speaking (H says), two such objects never touch each other at all, not because of how much space is between molecules or anything physical like that, but because "touching" is for H a technical term for a particular way that we (Dasein) encounter entities in the world. You might say that individual entities become foregrounded for us: They were always there in some sense as part of the stream we're swimming in, and they solidify as something actually encountered as a specific item. What makes this world (painting, stream) difficult to talk about is that it's not a collection of things, which again would be looking at "things" of the world as science does and just saying that the world is the set of all things. Rather the world is singular and doesn't have parts, and again, neither is it merely a container for all these items that are not parts of it (like many shoes in a shoebox). So this sounds as mysterious as classical discussions of God, whereby God is somehow entirely singular and simple despite having many properties and in some sense encompassing everything else. What's the deal? Is H actually giving an accurate account of our experience (our phenomenology) in describing this mysterious "world," or is he just engaging in gratuitous mystification?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is H a process philosopher? A pragmatist? How is "being with" for two people different than two shoes being together in a shoebox? Is immorality for H exactly a matter of treating another person as a mere present-to-hand object (per Kant)? We talk about facticity vs. factuality, concern (taking care, or in German besorgen ) vs. care (sorgen), knowledge vs. familiarity, and why you shouldn't call H's world Being an "environment."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;We're doing some Renaissance neo-Platonism with Peter Adamson: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsilio_Ficino" target="_blank"&gt;Marsilio Ficino &lt;/a &gt;'s theory of love as communicated through his &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3yzo57k" target="_blank"&gt;Commentary on Plato's Symposium on Love &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1475). &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/ficino" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to Peter's History of Philosophy episode about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We continue from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-296-heidegger-68206815"&gt;ep. 296 &lt;/a &gt;with our close reading on Martin Heidegger's &lt;em &gt;Being and Time &lt;/em &gt;(1927), covering in this part of the discussion chapter 1. Featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This selection (aka section 9) covers existence (in German, Existenz) vs. existentia. The former is Dasein's (humanity's) specific way of being, which involves possibility and thus choice. H was in this use an "existentialist," even though this was a label that he rejected.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The latter is the ontological category which H calls "present-at-hand" (or in the translation Wes has, "objective presence") an object laid before us to be focused on. This is what objects as science studies them are, and Aristotle's ontology assumed that everything that exists can be looked at in this way. This is the key ontological error that &lt;em &gt;Being and Time &lt;/em &gt;is supposed to address, and it's the same thing as the allegation that our modern intellectualism has fallen thoroughly into &lt;em &gt;scientism &lt;/em &gt;: Yes, of course there is an appropriate context for describing the world as a set of objects and trying to figure out the relations between these objects. That context is applied science, when we're trying to manipulate the world to make it do what we want. But despite science's pretensions, the "view from nowhere" that describes the world in this way does not allow us to fundamentally understand the world. Prior to this process of abstracting the world into "things," we find ourselves in our own bodies, already out acting in the world, and so H describes this "world" as fundamentally a background to such action, something taken for granted in our "average everydayness."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get into the details of this: Is being present-to-hand really a "view from nowhere"? Does the Being of Dasein really involve freedom and choice in the way we might think? What do "mineness" (i.e. Dasein is fundamentally individuated: my Being is mine) and authenticity really mean in this context, given that the whole point of existentialism is that we don't (as a species or as individuals) actually have an essential nature which then might or might not show itself? Is H even really an existentialist?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In parts two and three of this discussion, we'll get more into the passages where H describes what this "worldhood" consists of and how its elements prior to their objectification as "present to hand" are instead "ready to hand" as tools or appendages of our action, not actually focused on as distinct objects as we go about our business.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 6/20/22. Mark and Seth consider the close reading format as evinced in our new Heidegger episodes and get side-tracked into talking about Dr. Drew and vaccine hesitancy. &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-beginning-the-end/202104/dr-drew-pinsky-shares-thoughts-vaccine-hesitancy" target="_blank"&gt;Here he is answering questions about it &lt;/a &gt;, and I see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drdrew/status/1542873106603188224" target="_blank"&gt;he just had an AMA that includes talk about the infant version &lt;/a &gt;. I guess the main hubbub surrounded &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/dr-drew-roasted-covid-vaccine-passports-twitter-pasadena/" target="_blank"&gt;a tweet from April 21, 2021 about vaccine passports &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/04/13/dr-drew-pinsky-coronavirus-loveline/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a more extensive April 2020 profile about his general evolution &lt;/a &gt;. What do you think? Is he (as we commented &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/09/17/ep172-drew-pinsky-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;at the time &lt;/a &gt;) the best celebrity guest we've ever had, or is he (as one emailer commented to us) a &lt;a href="https://filtermag.org/dr-drew-trump/" target="_blank"&gt;Trumper &lt;/a &gt;that makes us look bad by association? (Or neither of these?)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;All that's in the first 15 minutes. We then shift to what we as individual podcasters carry around through episodes as an "agenda": social beefs that we feel like we need to champion to the public. Wes certainly still has a lot of these (see &lt;a href="https://www.wesalwan.com/" target="_blank"&gt;wesalwan.com &lt;/a &gt;), but clearly didn't see the need to insert his long-held beef against scientism in the context of Heidegger's phenomenology. Seth has started his own substack: &lt;a href="https://sethpaskin.substack.com/" target="_blank"&gt;sethpaskin.substack.com &lt;/a &gt;and is interested in the intellectual foundations of genocide.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we give an update/history of our attempts to produce the PEL book.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing our close reading of selections of &lt;em &gt;Being and Time &lt;/em &gt;from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/68206815"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, we come back on a different day without Wes and focus on two parts from the Introduction 2, sec. 7:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Sec. 5, where Heidegger says why time has to be the focus of the ontological analysis of Dasein (i.e. his description of the essential human condition).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Part A, on what are phenomena, according to Heidegger. This includes different takes on what the word "appearance" can refer to, and why Heidegger's phenomena are not "mere appearance" covering up what the world is really like. Instead, for Heidegger phenomena are what what truly appears: what shows itself as itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Part C, where Heidegger describes his phenomenological method. We're trying to figure out what phenomenology is to him, given that it's not sitting back a la Descartes and Husserl and describing what's in front of you right at that moment. Instead, we need to describe Dasein (us) in our "average everydayness," which requires interpretation ("hermeneutics" is the fancy word here) not of the here and now but retrospectively, thinking about how our lives in general run.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;Through all this we try to figure out how Dasein might be distinguished from animals: could they too be Dasein? And we try not to fall into non-Heideggerian language, even though doing so seems essential to actually understanding what he's talking about.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This close reading will continue with ep. 297, when Wes returns.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;This close reading of sections near the beginning of Martin Heidegger's &lt;em &gt;Being and Time &lt;/em &gt;(1926) is a direct sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-32-heidegger-11381085"&gt;ep. 32 &lt;/a &gt;, which provides an overview of his project. We re-introduced that episode in our most recent &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/pel-nightcap-67950983"&gt;PEL Nightcap &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this episode and 297, we read and discuss particular textual passages, so you can experience along with us what it's like to read this text with its peculiar terminology and approach.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here are the sections we read:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Intro 1, sec. 1, "The Necessity for Explicitly Restating the Question of Being", point 1, on why Being isn't just the most universal concept. Heidegger here is responding to and building on the discussion of this issue in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-279-of-being-57212449"&gt;Aristotle's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-279-of-being-57212449"&gt;Categories &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Intro 1, sec. 2, "The Formal Structure of the Question of Being" asks "what is a question?" The ancient Greek touchstone for this is Plato, who argues that in order to ask a question at all, we must always in some sense already know the answer (or at least the type of answers that are available). This idea comes up in several of Plato's dialogues (like the &lt;em &gt;Meno &lt;/em &gt;), but we most recently played with this idea on the &lt;a href="https://philosophyimprov.com/pvi28-questioning-adal-rifai/" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy vs. Improv podcast #28 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Intro 1, sec. 4, "The Ontical Priority of the Question of Being." The point of reading this is to clarify some of Heidegger's terms: "Ontic" is about individual beings and their properties, and if we're talking about the possibilities and projects of individual people, the adjective is "existentielle." These terms contrast with "ontological," which is about the study of Being itself, and the essential structures of human (Dasein) Being are called "existential." For example, we as Dasein are essentially "Being-Unto-Death," so that's an ontological feature of the human condition: it's existential for beings like us. But of course, we as individuals may or may not really be aware of our eventual deaths, and that awareness (or lack of it) is an existentielle feature of each of us as ontic, as individual beings. However, we only get an entry point into understanding the ontological via the ontic, which is to say we only understand Being by first considering the individual beings that we interact with in our lives, and so Heidegger calls that entry point "ontico-ontological." Our attempt to lay down a definitive interpretation of these three terms (ontic, ontological, ontico-ontological) is surprisingly contentious.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;This discussion includes Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan. Most of us read the &lt;a href="http://pdf-objects.com/files/Heidegger-Martin-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson-Blackwell-1962.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Macquarrie &amp;amp; Robinson translation &lt;/a &gt;(&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3HQOSjJ" target="_blank"&gt;buy it &lt;/a &gt;), though Wes helpfully provides &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3OFQkr6" target="_blank"&gt;a second translation &lt;/a &gt;for some parts from Joan Stambaugh. You may also wish to look at the interpretations by Hubert Dreyfus in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3OlTBvU" target="_blank"&gt;Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding on Kant's "Perpetual Peace," plus Jurgen Habermas' "Kant's Idea of Perpetual Peace, with the Benefit of Two Hundred Years' Hindsight." Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-295-kant-on-67387339"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about the two appendices to Kant's essay: first about "realpolitik," the idea that because other states will act immorally, then the wise politician must also act immorally. As you might predict, Kant disagrees with this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The second appendix spells out one rule for detecting when foreign policy (or really any kind of law) is immoral, and it sounds a bit like Kant's categorical imperative: If you can't state your foreign policy out loud without that being self-defeating, then it's a bad policy. So you can't, for instance, enter into treaties with the intention of breaking them, because if that's your policy and you state it up front, then no one would enter into that treaty with you.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, our returning host Seth summarizes the Habermas article, whereas Wes actually had to drop off the call near the end. Habermas has some wise things to say about Kant's various proposals given how history has turned out since Kant's time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/67387339" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on Immanuel Kant's essay "Perpetual Peace," we go further into how Kant's politics relate to his ethics and consider his actual policy proposals: each state must be a republic, i.e. somehow representative with separation of powers, and countries should join in a confederation. Kant also spells out the new idea of "cosmopolitan right," which only entails that all states have a right of "universal hospitality" towards other countries' citizens. So, for instance, you can't just shoot foreigners on sight, though you needn't allow them to freely immigrate either.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kant believed that on the one hand, people are apt to behave selfishly, but on the other hand, there's some kind of invisible hand or providence that can use this selfishness to bring about the kinds of changes he's proposing. For instance, the benefits of unrestricted trade will bring nations closer together. The cross-border influence of intellectuals will help make the best political ideas (i.e. liberty and cooperation) prevail in the long run. Since it's beneficial for nations to cooperate and avoid war, they will be motivated (on the whole, in the long run) to do this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also touch on Habermas' essay "Kant's Idea of Perpetual Peace, with the Benefit of Two Hundred Years' Hindsight," which we'll explore further in part three of this episode. Habermas thinks, for one, that a mere federation that states voluntarily join is not going to have enough enforcement power to keep states from behaving poorly whenever it's in their perceived interest. Also, cosmopolitan right should entail more, including the idea of basic human rights that every individual owes to each other, and so all governments owe to all people insofar as they have power over them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Immanuel Kant's essay "Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch" (1795). Do nations have the "right" to go to war? What principles ground just international relations, and are there structures and agreements that we can embrace to prevent prevent future wars? Naturally, we consider the current conflict in Ukraine as well as other recent wars.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kant's essay reads like a multi-layered peace treaty, with various "articles" stating what nations should agree to. In this first part of the discussion, we discuss the six "preliminary articles of a perpetual peace" that make up the first part of the essay:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ol &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;No conclusion of peace shall be considered valid as such if it was made with a secret reservation of the material for a future war.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;No independently existing state, whether it be large or small, may be acquired by another state by inheritance, exchange, purchase or gift.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Standing armies will gradually be abolished altogether.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;No national debt shall be contracted in connection with the external affairs of the state.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;No state shall forcibly interfere in the constitution and government of another state.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;No state at war with another shall permit such acts of hostility as would make mutual confidence impossible during a future time of peace. Such acts would include the employment of assassins or poisoners, breach of agreements, the instigation of treason within the enemy state, etc.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ol &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is our first peek into Kant's political philosophy since our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-200-kant-on-21956766"&gt;ep. 200 on his view of enlightenment &lt;/a &gt;, i.e. the intellectual and so political autonomy of citizens. As with that topic, we're concerned here about how his views of political rights relate to his &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-10-kantian-we-30313369"&gt;moral views &lt;/a &gt;. Kant saw nations as like people, with an organic unity based on their history and culture, and so just like people, their integrity should not be violated; they should not be merely "used," as when states are sliced up or sold off (article #2). They should act with integrity toward one another. However, Kant makes a distinction between moral rules, which apply to individuals just because we're reasoning creatures, and political rights. Kant agreed with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-3-hobbess-30313074"&gt;Hobbes &lt;/a &gt;that the latter are granted by governments, and so there are no rights whatsoever in a state of nature. In order for there to be rights that governments owe to each other and to the citizens of other government, there needs to be some sort of super-state: a law-making entity that exists beyond individual states. In part two of this discussion, we'll discuss Kant's proposal for a federation of independent states, which is different than a world state. We'll also say more about Kant's claim that in order to guarantee perpetual peace, all states must be republics (even though per article 5, we can't actually bring that about for other states; they have to work through their own problems).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3NkAuCf" target="_blank"&gt;Kant's Political Writings &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which contains this essay, or &lt;a href="https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/kant1795_1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read the essay online &lt;/a &gt;. The book of secondary readings (which we won't actually discuss until part three of this episode) we mention is &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3GSGEaj" target="_blank"&gt;Perpetual Peace: Essays on Kant's Cosmopolitan Ideal &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1995); we read the essays in there by Jürgen Habermas (which we eventually discuss) and Martha Nussbaum (which we really don't).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;There are a few things to explain here. First, I (Mark) wrote a book. It's not the PEL book you've always wanted; instead, it's something I was commissioned to do, using a publisher's title, structure, and tone. It's called &lt;em &gt;Philosophy for Teens &lt;/em &gt;, and it compresses a huge number of ideas and thinkers into an impossibly tight word count, delivered as a series of questions. The whole thing has to be understandable by 12-year-olds. That said, it may well be of use to any PEL listener as a quick reference guide, providing a map of how many thinkers fit together and a potential thing you could gift to anyone whom you want to bring into the philosophy fold. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3K4iNUQ" target="_blank"&gt;Pre-order the book here &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So I don't actually own the rights to this, and so can't sell or publicly distribute an audiobook of it (which I'd love to record), so I'm doing this instead: some readings that I'm discussing with Bill Arnett, my Philosophy vs. Improv co-host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first such recording and the ONLY one you will see on this feed. You see, Bill and I want to record a season two of our podcast (see &lt;a href="https://philosophyimprov.com/" target="_blank"&gt;philosophyimprov.com &lt;/a &gt;), and we haven't been able to get much advertising on it as of yet, so we're explicitly doing this as a way to seduce folks like you with a history of paying for my ramblings to maybe just pitch in $1/episode or whatnot over there. I'll be posting at least one more of these readings exclusively on PvI's Patreon page/feed (we're about to record it today), and the more people that sign up over there, the more we'll record. So please visit &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/philosophyimprov"&gt;patreon.com/philosophy improv &lt;/a &gt;to help make sure that show can continue to exist, and can have on more great philosophy guests like Barry Lam from Hi-Phi Nation, whom we just recorded with, author Skye Cleary, whom we're scheduled to talk with next, and Stephen West from Philosophize This, who I'm planning to feature on our Season 2 premiere in September or so. Since PEL doesn't feature a lot of philosophy prof guests, this is really my only forum for talking with them at this point!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding on W.V.O. Quine's "Epistemology Naturalized" (1969), featuring Mark, Wes, and Seth. Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-294-quine-on-66745874"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We take one more stab at making sense of the indeterminacy of translation that is part of Quine's holism about linguistic meaning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Then we turn to more implications about Quine's attempt to turn epistemology into psychology. Is Quine a behaviorist? (Was Carnap?) If you're talking about the "building blocks" of meaning, before you have full-on language and reference, it's probably necessary to talk about behavior, e.g. as Langer talked about sign-behavior that was preliminary to the use of symbols.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The "behavior" in question for Quine is actually a situation: being in the presence of some external object such that Carnap at least would identify the meaning of an observation sentence with that external sensory situation. While Quine rejects that due to his holism (there might be multiple "meanings" for a sensory situation), he still as empiricist identifies this public performance of a report on what's right in front of you as foundational for meaning, making this a related view to Wittgenstein's private language argument (which involves meanings being public, not private images in individual minds).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/66745874"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "Epistemology Naturalized" (1969), we work further through the text, getting into what this new psychology-rooted epistemology might look like. Quine remains an empiricist in that he agrees that whatever evidence there is for science must be sensory, and that we learn language through the medium of our senses (i.e. no innate knowledge). However, this doesn't mean that science can be actually deduced from observations. Like, reason itself does not tell us what the scientific method is, which then grounds our scientific observations. There are no a priori, unmovable principles underlying this method, and no guarantee that we're doing it right. Perhaps our current theories are tainting our observations. It's like we're in a boat on the sea and have to repair its planks (carefully! only a few at a time!) while floating instead of resting on the foundation of dry land.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So when we want to know, for instance, how the mind comes up with general concepts based on individual observations, instead of doing that how someone like Locke does, let's actually use the methods of scientific observation at our disposal, which could involve brain scans and/or various experiments designed to figure out what elements come first in this construction. The sort of speculation that philosophers like Locke used about that is useful, but is only a first attempt, to be corrected by the progress of science, rather than something firmly grounded by experience.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As Quine points out, the verificationist attempt to equate linguistic meanings with possible experiences goes back to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-20-pragmatism-11380562"&gt;C.S. Peirce &lt;/a &gt;, the founder of pragmatism.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On W.V.O. Quine's "Epistemology Naturalized" (1969), featuring Mark, Wes, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What justifies scientific theory? The classical epistemological project found in figures like Descartes and Locke seeks to find basic, indubitable premises that serve to ground the rest of our theorizing. Quine begins by considering Hume's attempt to do this by claiming that all we ever experience are sense impressions, so anything else we know must be based on that. Rudolf Carnap took Hume very seriously and tried to actually reduce the meanings of complex propositions to their base sensory components, and Quine's goal in this essay is to show why this does not in any way work. In fact, Quine wants to reverse the order by which philosophers base science on epistemology to instead propose a less problematic way of pursuing epistemology: through psychology, i.e. science. Making epistemology part of natural science is what "naturalizing" it amounts to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Quine relates the question of theory vs. observation that we've considered in looking at philosophers of science such as Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos to the pre-scientific context. According to a verificationist like Carnap, the meaning of at least certain basic sentences, which philosophers call observation sentences, is cashed out in terms of what sensory situations they relate to. So we tend to think that "it is raining" is certainly related to a person being in a situation where they're perceiving rain happening right now in their vicinity. If the sentence is being used literally and observationally, i.e. in its "normal" usage (as opposed to its use in a play, or as metaphor, etc.), then the sentence literally means that perception... or we should better say "perceptual situation," because we don't want to have to take into account the minor differences that different perceivers might have. The point is that anyone with the relevant senses in that situation, on hearing that sentence and understanding it to refer to that situation would both then know the meaning of "it is raining" and (importantly distinct for Quine) be able to confirm the truth of that sentence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;All other sentences/bits of knowledge according to an empiricist ultimately rely on these basic sentences. But as we've discussed in other episodes (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-154-wilfrid-50992909"&gt;Sellars &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-276-hegel-on-54925954"&gt;Hegel &lt;/a &gt;), the idea of a "theory-free" perception like this that everything else could be based on simply doesn't work. There are several basic assumptions about physical objects, time, and space that are already assumed by talk of rain happening now. Kant's solution to this was to say that those basic categories are part of the human makeup and are necessary to think at all. Quine doesn't want to go so far as that; instead, he says that knowing a language is knowing how to use words in their appropriate context, and this involves a mass of theory. To say what an individual observation sentence means, we'd have to also characterize the rest of the theory. Two speakers of different languages could have observation sentences of the same event (the occurrence of rain, for instance), and these sentences would actually mean different things, because of their different theoretical contexts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To explain this, he uses the image of two speakers who don't understand each others' languages trying to come up with a translation. If I see the person uttering some sentence "bango!" in the presence of rain, I might assume that word means rain (or rather, the one-word sentence means "it's raining."). I could then test it by pointing at other phenomena (e.g. snow, sunlight) and saying "bango?" and seeing if the person assents. So it seems like this is a route for translation, that "it is raining" and "bango" both mean (in the verificationist's sense) the phenomena of it raining now. But not so fast, Quine says. What if my foreigner thinks of rain as a persisting entity, as a rain god showing his liquid essence, whereas I have a meteorological view of the matter. According to Quine, our three sentences don't actually mean the same thing due to their different theoretical assumptions. Well, perhaps this difference could be tested for, if I were able to ask "is this the same rain as before?" For me, the answer would be no, but for the foreigner, yes (it's the same liquid essence). Ah, but what if there's a additional difference in linguistic convention, such that while I say "it's raining," the foreigner's remark would better be translated as "he appears as rain"? So if I ask, "is that the same rain?" the foreigner understands this as "is this the same appearance as rain?" Both of us answer no, because for me, it's a different cloudburst, but for the foreigner, it's a different occasion on which the singular wet god appeared. We're using the sentences in the same way, in the same perceptual circumstances, yet because of the interlocking nature of our various beliefs and linguistic meanings, we don't actually mean the same thing, and we can't even figure this out. Quine calls this indeterminacy of translation: an experience underdetermines its observational description. Quine even conjectures that two such descriptions might even contradict each other, yet each accurately describes the perceptual situation. (Though this claim is actually pretty wild, and doesn't seem possible to sketch an example of; in my example, the two speakers are just talking past each other by employing different conceptual schemes, not actually in contradiction.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To get clearer on this, you may want to review our past episodes on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-67-carnap-on-17045971"&gt;Carnap &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-66-quine-on-17045937"&gt;Quine &lt;/a &gt;, which provide more information on Carnap's "Aufbau" project that Quine is reacting to here and also gives Quine's argument specifically against the idea of synonymy, i.e. two expressions' having the same meaning, which is obviously an essential component for Carnap who's trying to reduce complex expressions to simpler ones that are in some sense synonymous with them. We also refer to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-38-bertrand-15462639"&gt;Russell's reduction of mathematics to logic and set theory &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-95-godel-on-w-30346855"&gt;Gödel 's demonstration of the incompleteness of any axiomatic system &lt;/a &gt;(like Russell's attempt).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Quine's account does not so much debate with positions like Lakatos' so much as complement them. Quine agrees like these modern philosophers of science that scientific advancement is not a matter of deductive certainty, because there's no theory-free way to interpret an observation made on an experiment. Like Lakatos and Kuhn, Quine would agree that in the face of an experimental result, there are choices to make about which parts of one's web of theory to change. However, he described Kuhn's position as an "over-reaction" for reasons that he doesn't go into. My sense is that Quine is interested here in the technicalities of meaning, not in actual scientific practice. The fact that in theory two contradictory observation sentences could both be true of the same observation doesn't mean that this actually happens in scientific practice, because the various competing scientific theories are not so profoundly different as the competing metaphysics included in my rain example. But one can also see how thinkers like Kuhn and Feyerabend might appropriate Quine's argument to support radical differences in conceptual schemes, and this is exactly why &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-191-schemes-19104205"&gt;Donald Davidson responded to this &lt;/a &gt;by arguing that any two schemes have to be actually translatable into each other for them to count as language at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3PEkj4i" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book containing this essay, &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3PEkj4i" target="_blank"&gt;Ontological Relativity and Other Essays &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, or &lt;a href="http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/3330/Quine-Epistemology-Naturalized.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read the essay online &lt;/a &gt;.

No, this is Mark, Seth, and Dylan on a later day, returning to the Haraway's "Situated Knowledges" with some second thoughts... at least for 20 minutes until Dylan's network crapped out, so we wrapped up.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We try our best to make her actual argument clear and give you a better sense of her language. How does an "agenda" in Haraway's sense relate to a Kuhnian scientific paradigm?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Start with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-293-donna-on-66167271"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We recorded this not knowing if it would be a Nightcap or a part 3. Starting next episode, we're planning to have a full-length, supporter-only part three for every episode (&lt;strong &gt;Note &lt;/strong &gt;: Like Nightcaps, these will only be made available at the $5 and above tiers, so $1 and $3 should upgrade if they want to keep on the train for the whole ride). Parts one and two will likely be a little shorter. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This will allow us to get a little less tired during our main recording (covering 1 and 2) and give us a chance to pick up the reading on a later date for the new part, starting fresh and giving us more time to either sink into textual quotes, do more evaluation of the text, relate it to the real-world, or whatever we feel like needs doing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is this the end of Nightcap? Well, no, but since we'll use this new part 3 recording to clean up loose ends, any Nightcappery will likely be shorter and devoted to other topics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective" (1988), "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" (1985), "A Game of Cat’s Cradle: Science Studies, Feminist Theory, Cultural Studies" (1994), and "Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Plantationocene, Chthulucene: Making Kin" (2015). Featuring Mark, Set, Dylan, and returning guest &lt;a href="https://www.unr.edu/english/people/lynda-olman" target="_blank"&gt;Lynda Olman &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is scientific objectivity? We &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-226-francis-30185810"&gt;previously looked at Francis Bacon's "four idols,"&lt;/a &gt;which are sources of bias that Bacon thought might block the natural light of truth from reaching us: things like prior philosophical commitments, thinking that "man is the measure of all things," that what's in nature will reflect the words we already use, and idiosyncrasies of individuals. Previous Marxist and feminist philosophers (Nietzsche too!) had turned this critique back on Baconian scientists, denying that there is any natural light of truth, any real objectivity that can shine through when biases are removed, because biases are inherent to the human condition: What we recognize to be true, what we count as evidence or as reasonable, will always be influenced by individual and cultural factors. Philosophers of science like Kuhn and Lakatos got specific about how a particular scientific effort is bound by its methodological assumptions, though unlike Marxists or feminists they didn't identify these as the self-serving assumptions of the demographic group engaged in the research.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Haraway, in "Situated Knowledges," is evaluating previous feminist attempts to undermine scientific pretensions to "a view from nowhere." While she denies that Baconian objectivity (the "light of nature" reaching us without bias) is possible, she also resists post-modern skepticism about the possibility of knowledge. Surely we don't want all claims to knowledge to be equal, so that there's no distinction between the claims of physics and those of doomsday religious cults. Instead, Haraway is looking for a new sense of objectivity that acknowledges and in fact benefits from the situatedness of scientists.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what does this "situatedness" entail? Haraway, like &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-230-bruno-on-31841488"&gt;Latour (Lynda's last episode with us)&lt;/a &gt;, thinks that we can't really separate science from politics. This builds on the Marxist idea that a thinker's social position will influence their thinking, but rejects the idea that this only has to do with class. And despite this being a feminist text, she doesn't really talk specifically about "feminine" science in particular either, which is something that previous feminist philosophers of science like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Harding" target="_blank"&gt;Sandra Harding &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Fox_Keller" target="_blank"&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller &lt;/a &gt;focused on. Yes, there is something reminiscent of "toxic masculinity" in how the methodology of science talks about predicting and controlling nature, about the pragmatism that leads science too often to try to then control people or weaponize its discoveries. But Haraway's critique is more general: Knowledge is never disinterested in the way that Bacon would like. We always have to consider the likely consequences, particularly in how human lives may be degraded or controlled, of any line of research. Though there is always a theoretical tendency in science to unify disparate phenomena, to look for a unified theory of everything, we can more effectively perceive truth by communicating our necessarily partial perspectives that each see different webs of connections.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Haraway's text is frustratingly free of examples. She insists that her way of looking at science yields surprising, innovative scientific insights, but I have no idea what any of these might be. The latter part of our discussion, then, consists largely of our resident physicist Dylan engaging with Lynda in how Haraway's viewpoint (I hesitate to call it an epistemic theory) relates to the history and practice of this hardest of sciences. Sure, we should keep practical consequences in mind (a hard-won lesson by those theoretical physicists whose work was used to make the atomic bomb, as discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-96-and-of-w-30347065"&gt;our Oppenheimer episode with Lynda)&lt;/a &gt;, and it's great to have people from a variety of backgrounds (nationalities, genders, classes) involved in both research itself and moreso policy decision-making allegedly based on science, but none of this seems to help clarify the debate in the philosophy of science that we explored by considering Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, and Feyerabend. How exactly does situatedness change one's analysis of a theory (including the evaluation of potential counter-evidence against that theory)?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One clue that Lynda brings up is Haraway's Heisenberg-like claim that when in science you mark an object (pick it out) it also "marks you," meaning that one insuperable barrier to objectivity as traditionally conceived is that the observer becomes part of what is to be observed. This means essentially that no two observations will be exactly the same, because they involve different observers in different conditions. But has any science ever demanded such identity of different observations? Can't they just be similar in the relevant respect to establish a theory?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But again, if we can't on Haraway's account separate theory from practice, then there are bound to be miscommunications in what "theory" two observers are trying to collaboratively establish through their two different runs of the same experiment, given that the two will likely have different purposes in engaging in the science. This is likely where the traditionalist should just reject Haraway's program: The whole point of a controlled experiment is that it doesn't matter who's running it or what their purpose might be. Except insofar as someone might violate the experiment by fudging the data obtained, two scientists really are engaging in an activity discrete from whatever the practical application of the research may eventually be, and thus their motives regarding this practical application &lt;em &gt;do not matter &lt;/em &gt;. And except insofar as there are provable distortions in how data will be read based on one's gender or race or whatnot, then these characteristics of the scientist do not matter either.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Haraway has a Ph.D. in biology and surely knows how laboratories work. Her articles to do not actually go into this, though. She seems more concerned with the overall scientific enterprise, including funding decisions, whose opinions are considered "authoritative," and how scientific discoveries get interpreted and applied to public policy. She's particularly concerned with how we define sex and gender, which as discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-235-judith-33741772"&gt;our Judith Butler episode &lt;/a &gt;are much more obviously subject to definition according to social norms than particles in physics. Haraway is also concerned with the overall way which we define ourselves in relation to technology, and thus her "Cyborg Manifesto" tries to adopt a perspective which both acknowledges the potential (inevitable?) dystopian horrors of modern technology but which also embraces the changes in perspectives that technology enables. Even (especially) in particle physics, the instruments we use to detect and describe quarks and such become part of our perceptual apparatus, i.e. they are tools, "ready to hand" in Heidegger's sense rather than something we (while engaging in the scientific observation) make into its own object. Rather than (as Heidegger did) thus reject such technology as dehumanizing, Haraway (like Butler) thinks that we should embrace it as a means to clarify and overcome what we might otherwise consider "natural" humanity. When we use tools, she says, they use us, and it's not really an option to just throw away the tools. Cyborgs are Haraway's version of what Latour called "hybrids"; they are the complexes created by any scientific or technological interaction.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The "surprising insights" Haraway thinks her viewpoint unlocks may have less to do with innovative scientific theories than new ways to see humanity in light of the cyborgs we create and the interlocking efforts of science and philosophy (i.e. cultural "science studies"), which in studying cyborgs create more of them. She refers to the interdisciplinary method for furthering such studies as a "cat's cradle" in the third article we read. This metaphor ditches the image of "competing theories," as seeing scientist (or politics) as a winner-take-all contest is another one of those masculinist points of view she wants to overcome. The cat's cradle involves all these interwoven insights and is made to be passed back and forth between different theorists in a cooperative manner.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The 2015 article that we looked at was something that anticipated her latest book, 2016's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/38VeSgi" target="_blank"&gt;Staying with the Trouble &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which you &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GrYA7sMQaBQ" target="_blank"&gt;watch &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HhdRSh0jpTw" target="_blank"&gt;hear &lt;/a &gt;her talking about if you'd like. For our purposes, the point is to use our current technological situation to look for a best course given what we can see, and not thinking in a utopian manner that she thinks will inevitably exclude and probably harm historically oppressed populations. Political solutions need to come from dialogues among actually effected people and not imposed top-down by philosopher-kings who disregard difference in calculating what they think is best for everyone.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Given that Lynda is a rhetorician, and her interest on all of the episodes she has helped us with has been how scientific ideas are discussed politically, this matter of a choice of metaphors in how we (as scientists, as citizens) see what we're doing is crucial. Whether talking about cyborgs, or cat's cradle, or what she in this last book calls the Chthuluscene era, she's engaged in a very different project than traditional philosophers of science, pursuing critique as a form of activism, and these metaphors are rhetorical tools she uses in that effort. She's also fighting against metaphors: the "god's eye view" that expresses the traditional concept of objectivity, the "divine light of truth," and of course the idea of scientific progress as a road taking us inevitable upward and forward. In keeping with her being against Heidegger, Rousseau, and other anti-tech thinkers, she's also arguing against some kind of fall from Eden metaphor whereby our embrace of "unnatural" tech has dehumanized us. The situation is much more complex.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read the articles online &lt;a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/HARSKT.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/4/4c/Haraway_Donna_1985_A_Manifesto_for_Cyborgs_Science_Technology_and_Socialist_Feminism_in_the_1980s.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/0/05/Haraway_Donna_1994_A_Game_of_Cats_Cradle_Science_Studies_Feminist_Theory_Cultural_Studies.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/159Haraway.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAvYwggLyBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggLjMIIC3wIBADCCAtgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMn-N5d75v0VGKPMqZAgEQgIICqaxXRWY1MpGGCndkU9Glz0zmBiycQVSd-j1be3cbotwJSnYvsiC1nHYNJdMKGa7RIo1CmuLz4qeIeo1s4bs0NorbIOHIBIptMYeBAMPJ0V9baWpikO_PxDmrB7744G4qmlZsBdXBmwvLVp5Ga8-RYauhhvZB6ZlWBPZecYZfc-VAmHPSO1sjWmkZTUDKJY_zm5UUbTxYTCn6HxEZI8VqgxXswGOrQ64PGenUYOyrOqYqfq3hxXtwRPVqTq5tAF4fk6WSz9jV7aK9cvsAXVMvRotwlm7DMmJN2B5rZAIF9dSxvpHnQQ1lNJ92rX6IUOX_9yZ3qs951dSlbHe3P_YemzTlW4mokxDVaPhjiGPsbmPJ5LI0JTfMR6MwLhr0brC9JAMzMqNC_WDTJ61A6kCylukkwzH768Ve9C4j2VcrBoPtNWEqEdIEbtjFlu0LI0nq5DBTfc92_HDNFaNUQ8FheAt-8F9ITpjmlsRXs-pyjD7shdAGM6zHttOwa-L7Z_QPEzW2kWHdGuo7R8EM01N-HnqraKUfXMcntcIGJ2UZbZn0U4RGFUOxN3DF_gQsoq9KgwcPHKruqx311YsUkzGh6OrRgXYKmV3UybfLAXmDauZYEZXEy55uYdqiksb1BBT2oLWfyEPSGWhlHr8W-Ejia6Fv3YwMnCqtwwqIYs7-eREdxRI8B8GZYze1ISiA9UHvfBYU-lUyynAjrn8sZB_pSn4a-yTK249xRmnQUB7zFGRYcCiVUF9G5qUsXEoYHQQ_jiVyyr3MdDhvfpg6hOWWRCtlXUz1wy9KESzo4ctZhiz9QSNsDSRpPF734qLpN_jP4xOSuoTAADYX-kWDeD3KXKefS4Wna-qbHBpUEw7NKwd_u580VV1RsyVP2b-GUPAlEDj_kxwX29-nEg" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 4-15-22. We are old, and we talk about Seth's back, Wes' e-bike, and Dylan's kettle bells.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dylan talks &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3OO3e7f" target="_blank"&gt;Station Eleven &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(the book). He has posted &lt;a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/liberal-education" target="_blank"&gt;this comic &lt;/a &gt;to Slack about liberal arts education.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then re-visit how to understand meaning in music given our completion of Langer. Does the blues as played on a certain occasion have to "mean" something?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;After a bit of that, we pre-discuss a potential Shakespeare episode. It's been a long time since we did a play. We should obviously do Shakespeare on the show at some point (if the appeal of this hasn't been removed by &lt;a href="https://subtextpodcast.com/?s=shakespeare" target="_blank"&gt;(sub)Text &lt;/a &gt;), but I've been intimidated by that prospect, not least because &lt;a href="https://www.stagemilk.com/length-of-shakespeare-plays/" target="_blank"&gt;most of his plays are very long &lt;/a &gt;. This is the time to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/contact-pel/" target="_blank"&gt;speak up &lt;/a &gt;if you have suggestions for how we should approach this (or if you're an experienced actor and want to participate the audioplay).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;And then back to Langer... can we be critical now about what we just read? What exactly is her epistemic theory as it relates to "&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-154-wilfrid-50992909"&gt;the myth of the given &lt;/a &gt;," the Kantian theory-laden character of experience, etc.?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This evolves into a discussion about whether the "this" in Hegel's account "&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/08/13/ep276-1-hegel-perception-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;sense-certainty &lt;/a &gt;" is linguistic. Does pointing at something involve linguistic elements, and is that why animals do not seem to understand pointing? For more information on the scientific consensus about animals on pointing, that they can use pointing as a sign but don't have the "theory of mind" concept of joint attention (i.e. the animal knows your attention is on something and so their attention should be there too), see the work of &lt;a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Oxford/Carpenter_Joint_Agency-and-Joint-Attention_2013_1760235.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Tomasello &lt;/a &gt;. Relatedly, was Langer's information about great apes understanding language out of date, and does it matter?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are we just retreading what we just did? This should be considered Nightcap surpassing itself and becoming what will come next: a "Part 3" episode that allows us to reconsider what we just read on a different day. Perhaps that will mean (as it does here) that we're relating this more to our actual lives, or perhaps (as it will for the next one) be more reading quotes from the text in a Close Reading style. While we will not abandon Nightcap altogether, you can look forward to more substantial treatment of texts via regularly issued Part 3 episodes and fewer pure shooting-the-breeze Nightcappery. Your feedback as we go forward will certainly be taken into account so we can balance these two fun activities.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, should we read more whole books as we just did with Langer, Scruton, and Malebranche?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Susanne Langer's &lt;em &gt;Philosophy in a New Key &lt;/em &gt;(1942), ch. 8-10 ("On Significance in Music," "The Genesis of Artistic Import," and "The Fabric of Meaning" respectively), plus ch. 7, "The Image of Time," from her &lt;em &gt;Form and Feeling &lt;/em &gt;(1953). Is music a language? If it's "expressive," what exactly does it express?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Langer focuses on music to get at the sorts of symbolism associated specifically with art because it lacks linguistic or pictorial elements, which already involve representation apart from their artistic uses. Again following Ernst Cassirer (ch. 9 of his &lt;em &gt;An Essay on Man &lt;/em &gt;includes a lengthy treatment of art), she focuses on art's use of "significant form," which distinguishes music from, for instance, a keening cry of sorrow or a whoop of joy. While ch. 9 engages in more anthropological musings about how music might have been presaged by non-musical elements like such shouting, as well as banging and chanting in rhythm, ch. 8 gives her semantic analysis of music.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Music cannot be a language, according to Langer, because it lacks a vocabulary: a set of word-like units associated (arbitrarily) with particular things that those "words" would refer to. Yes, we can all recognize a scale going upward, and maybe this tends to give us all a certain feeling of rising, but what emotional effect this is actually intended to have depends on the context. Langer describes an artwork as a single "idea" by an artist, elaborated. Even if elements though of in a different context are added, they all serve (if it's a good artwork) to add details to that idea.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what are these ideas? Romantic philosophers had claimed that music was a direct expression of the emotions of the performer (or composer), which engendered a response by Kant and others (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Hanslick" target="_blank"&gt;Eduard Hanslick &lt;/a &gt;is the name that she focuses on) insisting that music (and other "pure" arts) just present beautiful forms that have no external meaning. Langer sought a middle ground between these views. We all recognize a soulfully played, mournful musical phrase as sad. This is not to say that it "means" in the sense of denotes sadness in the way that "cow" denotes that particular kind of animal. But it has a connotation of sadness. Some musical connotations may be merely conventional, like it sounds like something you've heard, and so gains connotations from that prior experience. But a lot of it seems more natural and biological than that: Fast or slow, high or low, intense or soft music all have a corresponding set of human feelings. In &lt;em &gt;Form and Feeling &lt;/em &gt;, Langer specifically says that what music represents is the human sense of time, which we can't put into words, but which everyone recognizes, and which is different (per Bergson and Heidegger among others) that the kind of time that science and practical life uses to record and plan activities. In human time, not all minutes are the same length, since something boring or especially vivid can seem much longer than the time taken while we're engaged in something breezy and fun.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So this is all another exploration of the different kinds of meaning, i.e. symbolism, we deal with. Like the non-verbal symbolisms discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-291-cassirer-65016318"&gt;ep. 291 &lt;/a &gt;involved in rituals and religious feelings and expressed via metaphors and myths, art provides us ways of communicating about things that can't be spoken of, because there are no words for them. Art provides us a way to both communicate via connotations, where a gesture (or word, in the case of a poem or story or whatnot) brings up something associated with that in our imagination, and more importantly allows for novel articulations of "ideas" about human experience that we may recognize in ourselves, or which may introduce us as if by acquaintance to some new facet of human experience. Art is a way for us to try to figure out the world and our place in it and potentially try to share that with others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This relates to her primary critique of the modern age, summed up in ch. 10: By insisting that only "clear thinking" is legitimate (this is pretty much the motto of analytic philosophy), that all real thinking is articulated in language, that shrinks us as people and denies basic human needs. It's very natural for a philosophically inclined person in the modern age to despair of all the irrationality that people engage in and insist on clear, literal statements whose truth can be evaluated dispassionately, and there are of course real social problems (e.g. conspiracy theories, religious nonsense, social sentiments rooted in resentment) that this approach can help address.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But taking this too far results in scientism, in thinking that we can settle all human problems including problems about ethics and the meaning of life, with the same methods we might use to settle a dispute in physics or chemistry. Langer suggests that some of the most important things we need to understand and communicate employ non-literal symbolism. A piece of music, because "the statement" it makes does not involve reference to objects in the external world, can simultaneously connote opposite ideas, reflecting the ambivalence and conflict we actually feel about many things. A great work will be "true" to human experience, and a full picture of logic, i.e. the relations among symbols, needs to include an understanding of this kind of truth as well as propositional truth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;Form and Feeling: A Theory of Art &lt;/em &gt;goes into great detail about all the various arts, showing where Langer took theory introduced in &lt;em &gt;Philosophy in a New Key &lt;/em &gt;, and is why she's remembered primarily as a philosopher of art who laid the foundation for the work of Nelson Goodman that we discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-28-nelson-on-11380849" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 28 &lt;/a &gt;(who I'm told rather superseded her in terms of influence). &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3OApEJi" target="_blank"&gt;Purchase &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3OApEJi" target="_blank"&gt;Form and Feeling &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/1/11/Langer_Susanne_K_Feeling_and_Form_A_Theory_of_Art.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

Langer's account may give us a route to say how animals and babies can have some sort of self-consciousness without their having language.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about sacred objects, symbolism as play, how emotions and symbols interact, and how all this prepares us to discuss art next time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ernst Cassirer's his &lt;em &gt;An Essay on Man &lt;/em &gt;(1944), ch. 6-7, and Susanne Langer's &lt;em &gt;Philosophy in a New Key &lt;/em &gt;(1942), ch. 6-7. This discussion featuring Mark, Wes, and Seth follows the introduction of these books and the argument that we are primarily symbolic creatures in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-290-susanne-64300111" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 290 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why do people produce ritual, mythology, and religion? According to Cassirer and his follower Langer, these are spontaneous, symbolic modes of self-expression. We should not see modern, scientific, literal thought as opposed to mythical thought as reason vs. irrationality, but need to understand that the kind of metaphorical thinking that went into myth is a necessary precondition for literal thinking and an engine for its continued growth. The two have a dialectical relationship, in that the earlier mythological type of thinking is still latently a part of modern thinking, though this is often unrecognized given our scientific mindset.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Cassirer argued against Darwinists who merely look at human behavior with a functionalist eye: What survival strategy do these activities serve? So if the ancient Greeks thought that lightning is Zeus throwing thunderbolts, a Darwinist might see that as an attempted scientific explanation of lightning, but of course this would be a very bad one, that does not in fact help us to survive at all: to predict where lightning will strike or what to do about it. Rather than interpret myths as bad science, Cassirer argues that it is a projection of social relations onto the world, bringing people in relation to it as to a society. So in the face of potentially hostile, alien nature, the message of myth is that we're all connected and can be at home in the world. This explanation better acknowledges the richness of human needs than Darwinist ones that focus merely on survival strategies.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Langer presents this as a historical progression, where ritual is developed first, then myths, then religion. So you might think that first people made up stories about gods, then developed rituals to serve them, but to Langer, the ritualistic activity as morale-booster for the community comes first, aimed initially at some indefinite super-human forces, then stories get superadded onto these. Another progression and contrast that she describes is between fairy tales, which are basically dream fantasies put into narrative form, and religious mythology, which are not about some hero (like Jack who climbed the beanstalk) winning glory for himself but about coming to terms with cosmic forces (like Prometheus giving fire to humanity and being punished for it). Mid-way between these are stories of heroes like Hercules, Hiawatha, and Maui who are at once human and have some fairy-tale-like adventures but also take actions with cosmic effects. Again, the personalities of the gods that such a hero might interact with are secondary and come later than the cosmic actions themselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Cassirer targets in particular the view that religion is all about our recognition of our powerlessness and dependence on the divine, which he sees as a Christian view that has been projected back on to older religions. No, the purpose that ancient people had in developing myths is to establish that even though nature looks hostile, we actually have power over it. To give Langer's example: People performed rituals such as rain dances (presumably when it already looked like it was going to rain) to show that they were participants in making things happen and not just passive victims of natural forces. If it didn't actually rain, well, then in that case the ritual was just not consummated, because nature was taken to be one of the players in the ritual along with the dancers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Cassirer's attitude toward Christianity (and monotheism more generally) is actually very positive, and the main progression he traces through the development of religion is from a wholly negative, taboo-based routinization whereby ritual gets hardened into having every action prescribed and policed, into a religion that gives people the opportunity to not just avoid violations of law, but to get on the side of God and so have not just prohibitions but virtues and ideals to shoot for. In this new moral landscape, our motives and thoughts matter, not just our actions, and so we get the notion of moral choice and thus personal freedom.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite much of the framework we discuss initially coming from Cassirer, we found Langer's presentation here easier to follow and with more helpful details, so our discussion draws most heavily on her text, which we'll continue with in ep. 292 when we get to her philosophy of art, which is the area she's best known for, not only in this book but in the subsequent &lt;em &gt;Form and Feeling &lt;/em &gt;(1953) which goes into detail about the various types of arts. We're reading ch. 7 from that along with ch. 8-10 from &lt;em &gt;Philosophy in a New Key &lt;/em &gt;, if you'd like to read along with us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 3/11/22. We have the war on our minds, and so are looking to cover Kant's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3JTIjNi" target="_blank"&gt;Perpetual Peace &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;soon, and maybe something on "just war theory" (feel free to share your recommendations). Perhaps we'll also look at Cassirer's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/36VoNBv" target="_blank"&gt;The Myth of the State.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes talks about conspiracy theories, and Seth brings up more books about fascism that we will not read. We talk some more about Cassirer and Langer, and what else they make us want to read. Dylan give an update on his quantum mechanics episode.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For our main dish, we discuss an email about how our Scruton episodes were insufficiently critical, which makes us reflect on what we're actually trying to do with the readings we cover in the podcast. Was Scruton arguing that we should be aesthetic fascists? What is &lt;a href="https://www.architecture.com/explore-architecture/brutalism" target="_blank"&gt;brutalism &lt;/a &gt;?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also, bona "fydes" or bona "fee-dace"?

We start off by considering whether the hardware-software distinction with regard to our minds can help make sense of what Langer has proposed in saying that symbol-making is basic to us. Is she saying that we're more flexible (software-driven) than evolutionary biology would suggest, or does her claim that symbol-making is built right into our senses mean that we're actually hard-wired to symbolize, and so her characterization does not imply more variations different people and groups?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about pictures (presentational symbolism) vs. language (discursive symbolism), types of symbol-pictures, and what it means for sense experience itself to be symbolic.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does Langer's account fare against Wittgenstein's private language argument? We pick on Langer's account of the growth of language and more about how our communicative and representational abilities compare to those of animals. Feral children!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;It's the aesthetic sense of import that a word or sign can have rather than strictly its use that motivates our continued use of a symbol. This sets us up well for our next two discussions, continuing with this book first on myth and religion, and then on art.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Philosophy in a New Key &lt;/em &gt;(1942), ch. 1-5, plus as background most of us looked at Langer's main influence Ernst Cassirer via his &lt;em &gt;An Essay on Man &lt;/em &gt;(1944), ch. 1-5. Featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is human nature, and why does natural science have such trouble studying it? Cassirer's massive, three-volume &lt;em &gt;Philosophy of Symbolic Forms &lt;/em &gt;(1923-1929) provides the blueprint and starting point for these more popular works that we'll be reading over our next three episodes. In this episode we lay out the arguments for man as "homo symbolicus," the symbol-making creature. This is an epistemological view about how we know the world (Cassirer was a neo-Kantian), and also a theory contra Darwinists that argued that all action must have originated for instrumental reasons: to help us survive. We focus on Langer's views about speech and non-verbal symbolism like pictures.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In ep. 291, we'll go on to discuss Cassirer and Langer's views of ritual and myth-making, and in ep. 292 we'll deal with Langer's philosophy of art, which was really our reason for choosing this topic: to add another perspective to our recent treatments of aesthetics. But the way Langer's book built up its case gradually made us unwilling to simply jump to the later chapters on art, and given the debt that Langer acknowledges to Cassirer, and the fact that Cassirer wrote his own popularization at around the same time (as one of his final works; he died in 1945), made us want to look to Cassirer's parallel account. The two books read very similarly, with lots of references to then-contemporary science surrounding language acquisition, studies of symbolic abilities in animals and impaired people, etc. They each begin with a polemic chapter explaining how the scientific world-view that has been so successful in producing results in the physical sciences has hit a dead-end with regard to humanistic problems. Cassirer stresses the philosophical problem of man's knowledge of himself, while Langer talks similarly to Lakatos or Kuhn in positing that the &lt;em &gt;generative ideas &lt;/em &gt;behind historical philosophy (i.e. the mind-body distinction and consequent use of "fact" as the goal of physical science) have run dry, and that a "new key" is needed to open a new phase in philosophy: the symbol.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Langer explicitly considers &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-8-tractatus-30313266"&gt;Wittgenstein's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-8-tractatus-30313266"&gt;Tractatus &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;and how that work laid out the principle of logical positivism: If you can't put something in language, which is reducible to statements about states of affairs of the world, then you should just be silent. For Langer, explicitly denotative language where every word has a precise, defined meaning is just one kind of symbolism, and so many of our meanings can't be conveyed in language: Thus the need for art, and ritual, and spontaneous, expressive utterances, which are in fact what are required for us to have systemic language.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Langer (and Cassirer; there's a comparable point in his text for most of the points made here about Langer) distinguishes between signs and symbols. Signs are indicators, and can even be symptoms, as in smoke is a sign of fire. But signs proper are intentional communications for a purpose, like an animal making a noise to announce the presence of predators. Importantly, signs always indicate that the hearer is supposed to look for and expect something (or actually do that thing), whereas symbols can refer to things not present, and can be used in situations where the only point is to bring the symbol's referent to mind, not such that anything in particular should be done with regard to that referent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Langer points to a human baby's use of nonsense talk as key to understanding how we can use symbols but animals (who don't babble in this way) cannot. For animals, sounds (and gestures, etc.) are always for a purpose, and so there's no semantic indeterminacy, no room for ambiguity or artistic expression. Whereas people just like making sounds, and really like when they hit on naming, and so want to then name everything. Langer discusses the education of Hellen Keller and another blind and deaf person: how when their teachers tried to get them to use word-signs when they wanted something, it didn't work, but in both cases the breakthrough was when they were just identifying things: with Keller, it was famously water.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So Langer's argument is against linguistic pragmatists that argue that language comes out of the need to communicate, whereas Langer sees symbolism as an absolutely basic human activity. We do not perceive the world directly, but instead use symbols to break it up into thinkable objects and situations. Langer claims this happens even pre-linguistically and at the level of processing by the individual senses: That the eye does not store a literal light-copy of the world but processes it according to symbols. Every time we see some new situation and think that it's "the same" as a previous situation (of course it can't be exactly the same), we're grouping the situations together metaphorically, and this is how language developed in the first place. For example (and Langer admits this is speculation), if primitive people engaged in some group ritual, like after a hunt, then the cries they'd use during that ritual could get fixed by tradition over time. Then someone could use that utterance to refer to the ritual even when it isn't happening right then. Even then, the reference would be pretty vague, because it's picking out a whole recurrent situation. So then inflections might be used to help distinguish whether the speaker is referring to the ritual that was last week, or the one coming up, or picking out some aspect, like maybe it could be used metaphorically to refer to some other joyous group occasion, because there was no separate word for that yet, and eventually we'd have the general concept "celebration."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;An example in the language we're familiar with is the expression that "a river runs." This was probably originally metaphorical, in that it moves as a human runs. But now it's just how we describe moving water, and also we say "a fence runs along the side of a house" or "the property line runs..." which are even further removed from what was presumably the original sense of running (people), so now the term just means "spans." The point is that it's not as Wittgenstein implied, that we have literal, descriptive language as the primary and proper use of language, and then poets come along and use it in crazy ways, but that poetic, metaphorical thought is at the heart of language's development over time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Cassirer mentions &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-92-henri-on-w-30346202"&gt;Henri Bergson &lt;/a &gt;several times in his account, and the story is similar: Bergson was claiming that our initial ways of cognizing the world (like our perception of time) are not atomistic and quantifiable a la natural science, but that those atomistic ways of thinking are later, rigid developments of a more natural attitude.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3qqYavh" target="_blank"&gt;Buy Langer's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3qqYavh" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy in a New Key &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/6/6c/Langer_Susanne_K_Philosophy_in_a_New_Key.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ueKFjg" target="_blank"&gt;Buy Cassirer's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ueKFjg" target="_blank"&gt;An Essay on Man &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/1/11/Cassirer_Ernst_An_essay_on_man_An_introduction_1944.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/63784403" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, we get into more detail on David Hume's "The Standard of Taste" (1760).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hume starts out with a paradox: On the one hand, we believe that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; it's not a property of objects but of the interaction between an object and an observer. On the other hand, some works are obviously, objectively more beautiful than others, and anyone with a different opinion about them must be in error: not paying attention, or not knowledgeable enough to judge, or just has bad taste. Hume's task is to do justice to both of these intuitions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We explore the relation of aesthetics to ethics and the relation between sentiments about these things, which will be different for different people and are never technically "wrong" (i.e. you feel what you feel), and judgments, which are about the actual things in the world and can certainly be incorrect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ironically, though, even though I've just said that judgements about fact can be right or wrong (which means correct or incorrect), while sentiments can't, it's the sentiments that ultimately ground right and wrong in the moral sense, because they're sentiments about value. We're running here into Hume's famous fact-value distinction, which is not clearly spelled out in this particular paper, but the distinction works the same for Hume in the realm of aesthetics as it does for ethics. Just as no set of facts determines the ethical worth of an action a priori, no factual characteristics of an object can force us to deduce that it's beautiful or ugly.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is a logical and epistemic point and shouldn't necessarily be taken to undermine the search for a single moral or aesthetic principle; Hutcheson, as we saw in part one of this discussion, found such a principle in both areas. You may recall, though, that &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-58-what-moore-17045411"&gt;G.E. Moore &lt;/a &gt;did conclude that no such ethical principle was available: that something's being good is just a sui generis property that we intuit (technically it's general principles like "gratitude is a fitting response to generosity"; we still have to use reason and judgment to figure out whether any particular situation exemplifies such a principle). And Hume (and Scruton), unlike Hutcheson, does not really try to give a principle of beauty, but instead focuses on the qualities that a competent judge must have. So the situation for Hume's aesthetics is like virtue ethics, where instead of looking for ethical principles, we look for a sage or hero to emulate. But still, the value of this model in both cases is that they are the ones who best understand works/actions and how to evaluate them accurately. Their sentiments are well aligned to the objects, which means that the sentiments are ones that they ought to have.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This seems potentially circular, in that sentiments are supposed to be the source of normativity, yet some sentiments can actually be inappropriate. We wouldn't necessarily want to call those sentiments morally wrong, but they're faulty indicators of what they beautiful (or ethically good) really is. So you can see why Moore might want to characterize the situation (with morality; I'm not sure if he even wrote about aesthetics) as a matter of moral goodness being an property in the world (as opposed to a sentiment in people) that we detect, albeit a "non-natural" one, to distinguish it from a mere state of affairs like the amount of pleasure or pain that it involves. Moral and aesthetic judgments are paradoxically about things in the world yet rely for their truth value indirectly on human sentiments. It's just that they don't rely just on the individual sentiments of the one person making a judgment at that moment, but on the sentiments of the community of competent judges, where "competence" gets cashed out in terms that are supposedly value neutral. For instance, the judge must be adequately educated about the type of art (or whatever) that's being judged, must be thinking clearly and free from prejudice, must have a discerning eye or ear.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scruton observed that these examples I just gave sure don't look value neutral: "adequately," "clearly," "discerning," and I haven't listed the most important one, which is that the judge must have good taste, as that criteria is clearly circular: we're trying to determine what good taste amounts to by looking to judges, but can only judge the judges by asking if they have good taste. Scruton didn't think there was any way out of this circularity, but that may just be the situation we're in as individuals. Aesthetics (and morality) are ultimately human inventions, though they're aimed transcendently, positing some sort of ultimately beauty (and goodness) that is probably not really pre-existent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I like the comparison to the pragmatist view of truth according to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-20-pragmatism-11380562" target="_blank"&gt;C.S. Peirce &lt;/a &gt;: For Peirce, truth is whatever investigators given enough time would eventually agree upon, and for Hume (and Scruton), true beauty is whatever it is that critics would eventually agree on given infinite time to learn and argue about it (and something comparable goes for ethics). The best we can do is approximate this kind of thing by actually having arguments about truth and goodness, always knowing that we may be blind to some important aspect of things, which should make us modest and not some kind of "beauty fascists" who decide we have it all figured out and so look down on those peons who don't. So should we, contra Scruton, thus be effective democrats when it comes to taste, allowing everyone to have their own opinions without judgment? No, this lack of critical engagement is absolutely not what the ongoing process of argument and improvement is about, but we also can't just dismiss without engagement, assuming that some whole class of people is merely ignorant. Aesthetics should not be, as &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-137-bourdieu-50808431"&gt;Bourdieu &lt;/a &gt;diagnosed, just some class game by which the elite show themselves to be distinct from the masses, but a cooperative process of making each other more sensitive, more attuned to beauty (and ultimately goodness). Hume's essay gives us some demonstrations of how this actually works, and our discussion includes our reflections on our experience with this re. wine, music, Shakespeare, etc.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On David Hume's "The Standard of Taste" (1760) and its two main influences: &lt;em &gt;The Moralists: A Philosophical Rhapsody &lt;/em &gt;(1709) by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, aka the third Earl of Shaftesbury, Part III section 2 "Beauty," and &lt;em &gt;An Inquiry Concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony, Design &lt;/em &gt;(1725) by Francis Hutcheson.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How do we know what opinions about beauty are correct? British empiricists starting with Shaftesbury posited that we have a distinct sense that detects beauty. They called it an inner sense to distinguish it from the five outer senses, so it's an operation of the mind (not the sense organs), but at the same time it's not the faculty of Reason: it's pre-rational. If aesthetics were a matter of reasoning, then you could prove that one work is better than another via logical argument, but it's essential that we actually experience works to have legitimate opinions about them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our purpose in reading these papers was to dig more into dig more into the crux of Roger Scruton's use of this theory in our last two episodes (which you needn't listen to in advance of this). It's important beyond the intrinsic interest that art and beauty have for us because these thinkers also have a comparable take on morality: That it too is something whose ultimate justification comes from individual experiences (tastes) and not reason, yet it's not for that reason merely relative, but instead there are objectively better or worse actions and artworks. Each of the three thinkers has a slightly different take on how this could be, with Scruton I think largely agreeing with Hume's aesthetic epistemology (or at least Kant's variation on Hume; Scruton has a problem with Hume's way of telling who competent critics are). Importantly, the point about "disinterest" typically attributed to Kant is present in this line of thinkers back to Shaftesbury, and that's what explains why some people's aesthetic (or ethical) views might be tainted, and so ignored, when we're considering what's really beautiful (or good).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We'd have to read more Shaftesbury to determine whether he was really an empiricist. John Locke was directly involved with his education, but a lot of the point of this is that contra Locke, we actually do have something like "&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-257-locke-44221275"&gt;innate ideas &lt;/a &gt;" which give us the ability to tell beautiful from ugly and right from wrong. Now, even Locke granted us many innate capacities to explain perception, so whether this view really contrasts to Locke is not entirely clear. Shaftesbury in particular had a Platonic conception of beauty and goodness, though. He claimed that when we admire the beauty of something, what we're really appreciating is its original, as opposed to a copy. So admiring a painting of a sunset is fine, but what's really beautiful is a) the sunset itself, and b) the mind that created the painting. When you admire the beauty of a sunset, what you're really admiring is the mind of God that created it. When you're admiring the mind of a painter (through the painting), what you're likewise really admiring is the beauty of the mind that created the painter, i.e. God's mind. So everything comes back to God, and the short section of Shaftesbury we read was actually just a highly influential digression about beauty in a treatise about morality, which like aesthetics is rooted in the innate human disposition to appreciate order and harmony.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hutcheson's essay was published as the first part of two in &lt;em &gt;An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue &lt;/em &gt;, with the second part being about morality and displaying a similar structure and epistemic theory to his treatment of aesthetics. It's important that for Hutcheson, the role of an aesthetic or moral sense doesn't mean that there aren't also aesthetic and moral principles available for us to characterize what is truly beautiful or good. It's just that these aren't principles of reason but are discovered after we reflect on our actual aesthetic and moral reactions to things. Like Shaftesbury, Hutcheson distinguished between finding beauty "originally," i.e. in natural things like landscapes, and he actually starts just with abstract shapes... and copies, i.e. artworks. However, Hutcheson didn't necessarily think that the first type of appreciation is somehow more noble and sensible than the latter. It's just more basic. We can appreciate a well rendered painting even if its subject matter is something intrinsically ugly, like a picture of poverty or war.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In ethics, Hutcheson is known for actually coming up with the principle of utility, prior to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-9-utilitarian-30313318"&gt;Jeremy Bentham's basing his whole ethics on this &lt;/a &gt;(70 years later!) and so inventing utilitarianism as a standard type of ethics. In aesthetics, the principle Hutcheson put forward was "uniformity amidst variety." For example, we find nature beautiful because of all the patterns we detect in it: how everything of the same species has things in common, yet there's such a variety among the species. Like Shaftesbury, this is treading into the area of the argument from design: What we really find beautiful is natural law, the complexity yet simplicity of the creator's plan, which we recently saw on display in the indisputably rationalist &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2022/01/23/ep-286-1-malebranche-causality-theology/" target="_blank"&gt;Malebranche &lt;/a &gt;. But Hutcheson wasn't a rationalist; we know about this principle because of what people actually value, at least when they put aside their personal interests and are able to have an authentically aesthetic experience. So Hutcheson was doing phenomenology: He asks us to reflect on what we (and babies) prefer regarding shapes. For shapes with equally-sized sides (like equilateral triangles), more sides = more beautiful, to a point, in that beyond 12 sides or so we stop being able to tell the difference. But an even number of sides when we're talking about shapes as complex or more than a hexagon will be more beautiful than an odd number, because the parallelism, i.e. uniformity, then contributes more beauty than the added complexity of the extra side. And a square or equilateral triangle will be more beautiful due to uniformity than a rectangle or isosceles triangle where the sides are not all the same length, and non-equal angles will also be a defect (e.g. in a parallelogram). These elementary examples are supposed to establish the theory, which can then explain why a well-rendered copy may be more beautiful than the original: because of the parallelism between the copy and the original. This is true not only for visual arts, but works conceptually. Just as we can admire the beauty of natural law just by thinking about it, so we can admire the beauty of mathematical theorems and also the verisimilitude of psychologically accurate story-telling or expressive music that copies human emotional life. This shows that aesthetics is not a direct result of the outer senses, i.e. it is not built into sight or hearing itself, but is a function of the mind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Most of our treatment of Hume comes in part two of our discussion, but in outline, Hume was less concerned with coming up with a theory of beauty than establishing the epistemic criteria for settling disputes about beauty. It's possible that two critics might disagree simply because they're different sorts of people who are captivated by different sorts of things, like a young person and an older person will have different temperaments and so different tastes. But given similar dispositions, two critics' disagreement will most likely result from one of them not really knowing what they're talking about, i.e. not understanding the artistic conventions being used, or not picking up on the relevant details about the work. So there's a role in Hume for expert critics who have very keen senses and are able to discern minute details and complex patterns in a work. These abilities can be improved with practice (to a point).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hutcheson stressed the limits to education. If we don't actually have the senses to detect beauty in the first place, then no amount of education will enable this any more than you can educate a blind person to see colors. In fact, adding more associations can warp our natural aesthetic reactions and make us irrational partisans of wrong views. For example, someone might think that the architecture of their country is the best on ideological grounds, i.e. because it's their country and they're patriotic about it. Hume was less concerned to establish this epistemic point, though he also followed Hutcheson and Shaftesbury in saying that taste can be tainted by personal interest. Shaftesbury gives the example of a coin. If you're admiring the coin for its intrinsic beauty, that's a real aesthetic experience, but if you're just thinking about what it can buy you, then that's not. Someone claiming that a $20 bill was more beautiful than a $5 bill is probably being deceived by the greater monetary value of the former, in that the two have pretty much the same artistic merit. However, someone claiming that the $5 is more beautiful due to their reaction to the greater moral character of Abraham Lincoln whose visage is on the $5 as compared to Andrew Jackson on the $20 is also deceived.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The interaction between morality and aesthetics in Hume is interesting. As with Hutcheson and Shaftesbury, the epistemology is largely the same in the two spheres, in that the raw material is human sentiments, and yet we use reflection on those sentiments to weed out the misleading ones and find what is truly good and beautiful. (We discuss Hume and Adam Smith's moral sense theory in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-45-moral-hume-15467492" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 45.&lt;/a &gt;) But in making aesthetic judgments, we can't and shouldn't just entirely set morality aside according to Hume. If an author is describing horrible behavior in laudatory terms, expecting us as readers to identify with the villain, this is a hurdle to enjoyment that we should not try to overcome, and it explains why archaic works (like Homer) will never affect us in the way they affected their originally intended audiences. So while knowledge about who this audience was can help us appreciate works and makes for a better judge of art, we who now have the more civilized (i.e. correct) ethical views rightly detect more beauty in a work that does not glorify callous violence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This of course brings us back to Scruton, whose book was explicitly a moral argument that beauty is essential to the good life, and that the best kind of art morally orients us towards virtues like sacrifice and away from a relativistic, equalizing nihilism that says that (to quote John Lennon) "whatever gets you through the night, is all right." This British strain seems particularly prudish, in that there should be beauty a la uniformity in the rhythmic movements of dance and yes, sex, but this gets brushed away on the grounds that such direct involvement in art is too "interested," too tied up with gratification of drives to be a matter of artistic appreciation. But if, for instance, the bloodthirstiness in Homer adequately represents and channels something about human nature, then we should be able to appreciate it artistically even if we morally object to what it depicts happening in real life. As with the mimesis in tragedy, wherein vicariously experiencing something horrible provides catharsis, the "flight from beauty" that Scruton objected to may actually be a useful way of facing awful things about ourselves. We can see beauty in its accurate representation, we can admire it as an apparent simplicity in our human nature (i.e. the Will to Power as God's uniform Will), and can even be happy in acknowledging the absurdity of our being constructed in such self-destructive ways (I'm thinking of Camus here) while also happy to have art to help us redirect our destructive impulses in ways that affirm life and connect us to other people. So I'm arguing that while Hume and Scruton are right about the value of expertise in deciphering a work of art, and there's of course something noteworthy about the various motivations that go into our various enjoyments, this attempt to firmly distinguish interest in artworks from the supposedly extrinsic human interests that they may incidentally help us fulfill is deeply problematic.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read online: &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetics-18th-british/#IntSenThe" target="_blank"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia article by James Shelley &lt;/a &gt;that guided our reading selections and summarizes each (plus Thomas Reid!). &lt;a href="https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/shaftesbury1709bpart3.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;This selection &lt;/a &gt;from Shaftesbury's &lt;em &gt;The Moralists &lt;/em &gt;includes our reading as pages 57-67. &lt;a href="https://oll-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/oll3/store/titles/2462/Hutcheson_Beauty1458_LFeBk.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the full Hutcheson book &lt;/a &gt;; our assignment was to read section 1 (p. 19-27), then skim sec. 2 and 4 and read 6-9 (p. 61-82).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding our treatment of Roger's Scruton's &lt;em &gt;Beauty &lt;/em &gt;(2009), ch. 5-9, from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/63145174"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;. We consider why we'd really be attracted to something that according to Scruton's account takes a lot of work. Dylan brings in architecture, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tbntlC" target="_blank"&gt;which Scruton also wrote about &lt;/a &gt;, leading us to wonder about the form/function distinction and whether that standard in architecture (the fact that a building is functional is part of its appeal) can be applied to Scruton's purist take on human beauty (i.e. human bodies can't have a function that we appreciate as part of appreciating their beauty).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scruton goes through various representations of Aphrodite and other women in paintings to say which ones are properly reverent as opposed to pornographic, e.g. the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_(Manet)" target="_blank"&gt;Manet &lt;/a &gt;which is OK vs. the &lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/631031643/laminated-placemat-boucher-the-brunette" target="_blank"&gt;Boucher &lt;/a &gt;which is not. He criticizes our "reality addiction" which is what he says is really driving the preference for porn (and reality TV, gossip, etc.) over art. To further elucidate one of Scruton's distinctions: fantasy seeks a copy of reality, while imagination is about aesthetic representation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We return to comparing Scruton and Plato on art (and bring in Nietzsche), moralizing and transcendence in art, art as truth-telling, and expression vs. representation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Roger Scruton's &lt;em &gt;Beauty &lt;/em &gt;(2009), ch. 5-9, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth. The latter half of the book completes the survey of types of beauty that we discussed &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-287-roger-on-62518837"&gt;last episode &lt;/a &gt;by considering issues in our appreciation of artworks, and then develops a moral and political argument for why relativism about taste, i.e. the "democracy of tastes" that says that all aesthetic judgments are equally valid, is bad for us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;His positive goal is to convince us that the narrow sense of beauty as enrapturing appeal (think of the Apollonian for Nietzsche: classical beauty as we find it in classical music and Renaissance art) is morally uplifting in a way that modern art and popular art are not. In fact, he diagnoses in the latter a "flight from beauty" that is one and the same with our flight from responsibility to what our ancestral cultures have developed, and so this book is actually an aspect of Scruton's famed &lt;a href="https://newcriterion.com/issues/2003/2/why-i-became-a-conservative" target="_blank"&gt;conservatism &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The conservative argument is essentially that there's a natural yet hard-fought accumulation of wisdom over time in culture, and for us to rebel against that wholesale is immature and dangerous. Scruton is particularly concerned about how the rejection of traditional sexual mores has led to a dehumanized take on sexuality, which in art shows up as pornographic images. Society has forgotten or actively rejected Kant's insistence on aesthetic distance, of the appreciation of beauty being fundamentally different than wanting to experience something that feeds desires and fantasies.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But the argument is not merely sexual; it has to do with "bad taste" on the whole dominating culture, whether that be in the realm of jokes or architecture or a million other little things that populate our minds and our environments. Scruton is advocating for a more careful curation of ourselves: self-respect and respect for others, with the consensus-building tendency that all artistic judgment is supposed to contain according to thinkers like Hume (whose aesthetics we'll consider next episode, but the account is essentially the same has his &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-45-moral-hume-15467492"&gt;moral theory &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The main dilemma about taste that Scruton's been dealing with in this book is that taste is neither a matter of grasping an objective feature of beautiful objects, e.g. symmetry (in our next episode, we'll see that Francis Hutcheson defines beauty as "uniformity amidst variety"), nor is it just a matter of how individual organisms react to a stimuli, i.e. purely subjective and idiosyncratic. The recognition of beauty is a rational matter even though it is also an experience that happens to us each individually. It is an experience that is available to all of us (to varying extents) and it is a central part of the good life. It challenges us to find meaning, to examine our own lives and emotions, and it "offers a place of refreshment of which we will never tire" (p. 196). In the same place (the conclusion of the book), Scruton states, "for a free being, there is right feeling, right experience, and right enjoyment just as much as right action."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is very much against the pluralism about art that we saw in Danto and Goodman, and Scruton has his own take on 20th century art history such that the best experimental artists in the early 20th century like T.S. Eliot and Arnold Schoenberg (who invented 12-tone music) were not rejecting beauty in the name of innovatively expressing new viewpoints, but were using innovation in a reactionary way to re-attain beauty that had been lost to kitsch and cliché in art that had become hopelessly derivative and cheaply sentimental by the late 19th century.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This suggests that even though beauty is supposed to be accessible to all and obviously good, there's a reason why the "low road" that Scruton is warning against is easier and more seductive. Clearly seeing true beauty takes education about artforms and how to perceive them, and some of this education and practice has to do with achieving distance from one's immediate desires, "getting over yourself" to apprehend beautiful forms and such even if these don't touch on your personal fantasies or gratify needs like being soothed, being aroused, or getting energy out. In fact, part of the ethic whose loss Scruton is bemoaning involves personal sacrifice. According to Wes' psychoanalytic take (which you can hear more about in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sub-text-4-and-21956697"&gt;his (sub)Text episode on Freud's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sub-text-4-and-21956697"&gt;Mourning and Melancholia &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;), even though such sacrificial art may not be the most immediately pleasant, it serves a vital function in maturation and so is in line with our overall good. The point is that authentic feeling, authentic relationship to a profound work of art, involves yourself in a way that has a cost. This is a similar cost to what Socrates asked for when he demanded that we all self-interrogate, and Scruton thinks that modern audiences are not willing to pay this cost. Instead, people desire to desecrate, to deflate the demands of maturity so that it no longer seems an indictment of our "improvised lives."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes refers to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-216-game-27073213"&gt;our past treatment of &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-216-game-27073213"&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;as an example of mere wish fulfillment in popular entertainment that should be opposed to the use of imagination that good art enables. Another touchstone was &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-243-poetics-36995524"&gt;our episode covering Aristotle on tragedy &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/dec/25/bambi-cute-lovable-vulnerable-or-a-dark-parable-of-antisemitic-terror" target="_blank"&gt;Here's an article about &lt;/a &gt;the Jewish, tragic origin of Bambi.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/62518837"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;Beauty &lt;/em &gt;(2009), ch. 1-4. We critically examine Scruton's claim that apprehending beauty is cognitive and never merely sensory, which would rule out, e.g. there being beautiful smells or tastes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also go into points from Scruton's chapters on natural beauty, human beauty, and everyday beauty. Appreciation of natural beauty seems to be something that's universal, and so a good thing to bring up against Marxist critics that say that art appreciation is just a bourgeois pastime. Scruton criticizes both the Marxists and evolutionary biologists. We can't merely explain the apprehension of beauty by referring to its alleged social purpose; this would miss the actual experience (phenomenology) of it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But there is a critique here as well of the idea that beauty is merely an object of contemplation. In the chapter about everyday beauty, Scruton stresses that tastes about human manners, the way we dress and hold ourselves, how we design the ordinary objects we have to interact with, is must more important to our daily lives, even if these things do not transport us to mystical delights.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Relatedly, Kant's insistence that beauty be different from utility is worth scrutinizing. Can't the beauty of a well-made tool be very much tied up in how well that tool functions? ...Such that if we didn't know what it was for, we couldn't even judge its beauty!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another aspect of this point in Kant is his division between judgments about beauty and desires. Being hungry or horny by looking at the subject of a painting or photograph is very different than seeing its beauty, and likewise, Scruton wants to stress that mere lust for a person's body is different than seeing their beauty, which is necessarily a matter of seeing that person as an embodied free individual. A criterion to test this, with regard to sexual desire or art, would be "could someone replace the object of my gaze with something equivalent without my minding?" The thesis is that if you desire a glass of water, any old water will do, and once you drink it, then you're satisfied. Lust can be like this, but mature sexual desire is for a particular person, wanting them in their totality, such that sex doesn't then really quench the desire, and certainly swapping out a different sexual partner would not satisfy that desire, though it might distract you with a new desire. Similarly, if you're listening to a great piece of music and someone switches it for another one, Scruton claims that you won't be satisfied by that: You wanted &lt;em &gt;that particular &lt;/em &gt;piece of music. However, if what you were really looking for was just to feel a certain way, then there might be any number of pieces of music that would do.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here's a question to test whether people actually read these: I've been talking in present tense about what Scruton "is saying" in the book, whereas in blog posts for the past year or so, I've used strictly past tense like "Scruton said," though I've allowed present tense sometimes like "the doctrine says" or "the book presents a theory." Which of these tenses do you find more natural, or is this just something I shouldn't care about being consistent about?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The other theme in Plato's &lt;em &gt;Symposium &lt;/em &gt;that Scruton is concerned with (in addition to lustful desire) is the sacred. For Plato, love makes sexual desire sacred: Through the beloved, we love the divine. Scruton thinks that appreciation of beauty is necessarily adjacent to this sense of divine, and so profane art that flees from transcendence will necessarily be inferior.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-77-santayana-27506227"&gt;our past episode on Santayana's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-77-santayana-27506227"&gt;The Sense of Beauty &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.

Scruton just died in Dec. 2020; he had taught aesthetics for more than 30 years, and this book provides an overview of issues in the philosophy of art. The chapters we read this time include an overview chapter, then treatments of human beauty, beauty in nature, and everyday beauty (e.g. decorations, fashion, etc.).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In ep. 288, we'll finish the book, dealing with artistic beauty and Scruton's polemical thesis about it. Scruton was well known as a conservative and scholar of conservatism, and his overall thesis and approach are anti-relativist: There is such a thing as good taste, and so beauty is not purely in the eye of the beholder, and it's not true that everyone's aesthetic opinions are equally valid.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Scruton gives a list of "platitudes" about beauty that any theory of the beautiful must accord with (or engage through argument), and we spend the majority of our discussion going through these:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ol &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Beauty pleases us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;One thing can be more beautiful than another.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Beauty is always a reason for attending to the thing that possesses it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Beauty is the subject-matter of a judgment: the judgment of taste.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;The judgment of taste is about the beautiful object, not about the subject’s state of mind. In describing an object as beautiful, I am describing it, not me.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nevertheless, there are no second-hand judgments of beauty. There is no way that you can argue me into a judgment that I have not made for myself, nor can I become an expert in beauty, simply by studying what others have said about beautiful objects, and without judging for myself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;[much later in the text he adds and refines one more] It is a non-accidental feature of human beauty that it prompts desire.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ol &gt;&lt;p &gt;These principles mean that beauty is objective in some senses but subjective in others. It's a judgment each of us makes individually, yet these judgments are not just about our own tastes, but claim some sort of universality. We seek consensus and want others to recognize what we see and share the pleasure we feel from beautiful objects. #2 about one thing being more beautiful than another is not just a statement about comparing great works of art, but about different ways in which we interact with beauty, from being wrapped in a transcendent, quasi-mystical ecstatic experience to the much more mundane concept of "fitness" that guides us in shaping our environment and activities.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Two of his ongoing points of connection to philosophical history are &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-100-platos-33200350"&gt;Plato's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-100-platos-33200350"&gt;Symposium &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-105-kant-what-50223733"&gt;Kant's account of beauty and "disinterested interest."&lt;/a &gt;His view is also influenced by internal sense theories like Hume's, which we'll consider in ep. 289; it's similar to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-45-moral-hume-15467492"&gt;Hume's moral sense theory &lt;/a &gt;. He also refers to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-107-edmund-on-50223986"&gt;Burke's theory of the sublime &lt;/a &gt;to help us distinguish between two concepts of beauty, the first of which is just "aesthetic success" of any sort and the second is a particular type of success: "enrapturing appeal."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3LpURxf" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or try &lt;a href="https://portalconservador.com/livros/Roger-Scruton-Beauty.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're concluding our treatment of &lt;em &gt;Dialogues on Metaphysics and Religion &lt;/em &gt;(1688), focusing on dialogue 6 where M. says why a proof of the existence of the external world isn't possible, yet we should believe it anyway on the basis of "revelation," which means both Biblical (the Bible talks about things created) but also the "natural revelation" that sensation itself provides.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what is this natural revelation? We have to take one more swipe at M's epistemology: Sensations are implanted in us by God according to His nature, which is to say the laws of nature. And we then have to use reason to evaluate these sensations and say which ones actually reveal things in the external world, and which might be illusory, because we as fallen creatures (original sin) can't read God's signals without error and confusion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But this reasoning about the existence of objects will not be deductive: There's a lot we can conclude from the definition of God, but not that He must have created the world. We instead need faith, which for M. is an essential part of practical reason: Just to know that when we take a step, that the world will still be there to step on takes faith. Likewise, while we could like Descartes doubt the existence of a world, as a practical matter, we need to trust that it really does exist. M. is claiming that this kind of faith and faith in scripture amount to the same thing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Just to remind you, Wes' acronym GLUSAB stands for general laws of the union of soul and body.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also discuss dialogues 8 and 9, where M. gives his response to the problem of evil (his theodicy, which was prior to and influential on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-253-leibniz-42055569"&gt;Leibniz's famous theodicy &lt;/a &gt;). In short, God's impressive nature means that He acts simply, which is the same as saying that natural laws are simple, which is the assumption that scientists make. Were God to take our suffering into account in designing His universe, then He'd be constantly having to make exceptions to natural laws, because suffering follows causally from other features of the system. For example, astronomic movements result in weather patterns, and these patterns can ruin your day or even destroy your life.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This would be a fine argument (like Spinoza's) about the impossibility of miracles, but Malebranche is too orthodox in his beliefs to allow that. So it turns out that God does make exceptions to natural law in the case of miracles, but it's not like He just decides on the spur of the moment to make an exception. Rather, the web is just a bit more complex than we thought (or at least looks that way to us mortals) and was preordained from the beginning of time to include those miracles.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Start this with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-286-on-and-61502699"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, or better yet, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-285-nicolas-60960268"&gt;part one of ep. 285 &lt;/a &gt;where our treatment of this book starts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/61502699"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;Dialogues on Metaphysics and Religion &lt;/em &gt;(1688), dialogue 7 where he gets into his occasionalist theory of causality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about how this theory relates to mind-body interaction and the student character Aristes argues that there's nothing more intimate than the relation of mind to body and how the teacher character Theodore smacks that claim down.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does Malebranche's account relate to concepts in physics like inertia? He's against the idea that bodies can move (or keep moving) by themselves, yet inertia could just be a name for the pattern by which God causes bodies that are in motion (or at rest) to remain that way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The overall philosophy of science question is what is the relation of natural laws to things? Are they just patterns immanent in things that we model in our mind? That wouldn't explain why those patterns are there. Malebranche's answer is that there has to be something transcendental that explains and imposes those patterns, much like God was a lawmaker that creates physical laws that things obediently obey. This is obviously just a metaphor though, because it implies that each thing as its own power of motion that it exerts in response to God's call, whereas for Malebranche God literally makes the movements, which again makes it sounds like God is right there, immanent in the causal network and not a transcendent force governing its patterns.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The discussion concludes with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/61560816"&gt;part three &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Dialogues on Metaphysics and Religion &lt;/em &gt;(1688), dialogues 5-7, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth. Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-285-nicolas-60960268" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 285 &lt;/a &gt;, we've gathered more of the pieces of Malebranche's picture of epistemology, metaphysics, and science to explain his most famous view: Occasionalism, which is a theory of causality that says that God jumps in at every moment of causality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is this view as theology-heavy as it sounds? Wes argues that God is just a shorthand for whatever it is that makes scientific law consistent over time: a metaphysical underpinning to save us from a Humean take on causality. For both Malebranche and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-17-humes-what-11380418" target="_blank"&gt;Hume &lt;/a &gt;, it doesn't make sense for things in nature to exert the sort of necessity that is required by our naïve view of causality. No amount of counting generalities (induction) can lead us to a scientific law. So one can just give up on law as Hume does, saying that it's just something in our heads, or one can take Malebranche's route and say that God's nature is the thing (more a schema than a thing) in which natural law resides and from which it's imposed on objects in nature (and human souls too). God in Malebranche's system is a force that supports the existence of everything at every moment in time. God creates things in specific places, and so no other force could move these things from their God-appointed place. Instead, God in his eternal willing of the existence of things, wills them to exist at locations that change over time, and this is what movement is.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk about the comparative role of the senses vs. reason: Sensation just gets our attention, so we then turn to reason to actually understand anything about the world. Dialogue 5 starts off with an account of geometry, which is something Malebranche thinks can't come from experience (he's a rationalist, not an empiricist), and moreover, he argues that even though it &lt;em &gt;seems &lt;/em &gt;like we use imagination to understand why some geometric formula works (we just look at or picture a diagram and read the truth off of this), it's really only reason that enables us to know any of this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is our level of access to the intelligible world of ideas? Some ideas are like Platonic forms, which we can get an idea of but can't grasp in them in their fullness, while others we can know clearly and distinctly.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes' comments about the relativity of movement at the end refers to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens" target="_blank"&gt;Christiaan Huygens &lt;/a &gt;. Mark refers to &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-causation/#WhyDoesLeibRejePhysInfl" target="_blank"&gt;the physical influx theory of causality &lt;/a &gt;that Malebranche rejects.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

It has the intelligible idea of extension in it, which is what substance in the physical world is modeled after. This is an idea that is given to us as infinite: Space is infinitely big in theory. So what actually is experience given all this? Malebranche says that we don't actually experience the physical world, only our own ideas, yet we can't actually fit infinity into our minds to experience these clear and distinct ideas like substance in their totality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also cover how we generate general concepts, Malebranche's argument for the existence of God, the extent to which we actually see God, original sin, and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Dialogues on Metaphysics and Religion &lt;/em &gt;(1688), dialogues 1-4, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth. Malebranche presents a rationalist epistemology that is more like an early modern version of Plato than anyone else we've read. He comes chronologically between Descartes and Leibniz, and provided some foundational insights for Hume's take on causality, Berkeley's idealism, and Leibniz's theodicy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is the first of 2.5 episodes we're doing on this book. In the second episode, we'll deal with his famous doctrine of occasionalism about causality, which says that nothing actually ever causes something else directly. Instead, God is responsible for all instances of causality. This doctrine actually dates back to the Islamic theologian Al-Ghazali, who reasons that only God make something happen necessarily, and since causality involves not just one thing succeeding another (as Hume concluded) but something necessarily following something else, it must be the work of God, not something that individual material objects could bring about.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Malebranche's more immediate motivation is Descartes' notorious trouble with interactionism. Malebranche agrees that mind and body are fundamentally different, and also buys Descartes' vision of material substance, where this is only &lt;em &gt;extension &lt;/em &gt;, which means something that takes up space and moves around. Apparently, this idea actually came from Galileo, and very much informs Locke's take on primary qualities: What is really in physical objects is only shape and motion, and not colors, sounds, etc., which are in the mind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Given that notion of substance, Malebranche thought that there's no way that it could exert causal powers on the mind or vice versa, since mind is just for these guys a floating repository of ideas. This is the main reason for God to get involved with causality: so we don't have to worry about how mind-body interaction is possible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Malebranche, like Plato, mind (Reason in particular) is also a route to everything that is clear and true, whereas the bumpings among physical objects (including our eyes, nerves, and brains) that (via God) cause our sensations don't yield anything like true knowledge. In fact, Malebranche said we don't actually perceive the physical world at all. It is strictly speaking invisible. Instead, our mind contains sensations (which are confused) and ideas, which come from reason. So, for instance, we get that idea of substance from Reason, and that's all we really know about the physical world. We don't even know for sure that there is a physical world based on our sensations and this idea of substance, though Malebranche said we can reasonably have faith in that due to the Bible talking about physical objects.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also in this section of the book is Malebranche's proof for the existence of God, which provides some insight into what this intelligible world that Reason accesses is like. All ideas, Malebranche said, contain within them the idea of infinity as a fundamental component. So if I have an idea of "chair," then I also have the idea that this concept can apply potentially to multiple, and in fact countless, objects. Malebranche stressed that this is not merely a negative idea of infinity, like if we had the idea of counting, and stopping counting, and then just said, "what if we didn't stop counting?" Instead, he thought that even the idea of "never stopping" contains infinity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But the idea of infinity is transcendent. It doesn't fit entirely in our minds. It is a positive idea, yet we as finite beings can't fully grasp it. Well, God is the idea that contains (embodies?) this idea of infinity, so just through having ordinary conceptual thought about chairs and things, we for sure have this idea of God and know that God must exist, because in seeing the intelligible world, we're seeing God's substance directly.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, just as our idea of infinity is not fully adequate, because we only can think part of it (can't fit all of infinity in our minds), the same goes for God. So yes, we directly perceive God, but we only perceive that God exists, not what God's essence is. We can figure out through Reason that God is simple, and that's going to be very important for how we understand the character of God's causality, i.e. scientific relations between things in the world, but we don't perceive God's simple essence directly, just God's existence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3qYhaAA" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the version most of us used &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/malebranche1688.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/60036215"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "What Is Man" (1905). We work through Twain's metaphors for human nature: We're like engines made out of various materials, and these materials can be refined (through education, which acts to root out prejudice), though the type of material will limit its maximum capabilities even with refinement.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also get Twain's concept of instinct: "petrified thought," made inanimate by habit, presumably over the history of the species. This bit of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism#:~:text=Lamarckism%2C%20also%20known%20as%20Lamarckian,or%20disuse%20during%20its%20lifetime." target="_blank"&gt;Lamarckism &lt;/a &gt;is surprising given Twain's known fascination with Darwin.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another point Twain stresses is that we don't have the kind of control over our own minds that we might think. Most of our thinking is done without plan or even consciousness. However, is Twain right in saying that this means that the thinking and valuing and decision-making isn't done by &lt;em &gt;you &lt;/em &gt;? It's not done by your consciousness, but is your consciousness you, or is your mechanism you? Twain assumes the former, such that your creativity and deliberation are being done in you by some force that feels alien, but perhaps the lesson we should learn here is not that you are just an impotent bystander within your body but that you should rightfully identify with this body-machine that is greater than the little point of consciousness that Descartes called the mind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes compares Twain's determinism to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/u45SP7Xv_oU" target="_blank"&gt;Sam Harris' rhetoric in this area &lt;/a &gt;. We reflect on whether Twain is giving a take-down of genius. What are the practical consequences to the denial of moral desert? What exactly is wrong with Twain's observation that we only act to please ourselves? Mark connects Twain's theory to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-262-nietzsche-46964471" target="_blank"&gt;Nietzsche on asceticism.&lt;/a &gt;Seth connects what Twain is arguing against to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger" target="_blank"&gt;Horatio Alger &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A secondary essay that some of us read that connects this essay with Twain's fiction is Tom Quirk's "Mark Twain and Human Nature" from Blackwell's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3so8aHx" target="_blank"&gt;A Companion to Mark Twain &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. Apparently Quirk wrote &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3yBYREU" target="_blank"&gt;a whole book with that title &lt;/a &gt;too.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "What Is Man" (1905) by Samuel Clemens aka Mark Twain, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan and Seth. This rare bit of philosophy wasn't published until after Twain's death (maybe because it was too bleak?), but apparently reflects the mechanistic, cynical take on humanity that informed his literary works.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Twain was a tech guy; he was interested in the machines of his age, and he describes a person as a machine: a cog in the overall system of causes, producing nothing by himself despite appearances. You may think you've chosen some action or some up with some idea, but you're just delivering the output of the social inputs you've received in accordance with your make-up. So some people have more sophisticated machinery than others, and this can be improved with education, but no one deserves praise for their make-up or environment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Twain also describes the master impulse that everyone has: to content our own spirit, i.e. win our own self-approval. This is a variation on the "everyone is selfish in everything they do" theory, except "selfish" implies "self-interested," which sounds like it involves some objective notion of what is in our interest (good for us) and posits that we always pursue that. Twain's theory explicitly makes this "interest" a subjective matter, open to change by education and varying by personal temperament. If someone seems to be doing something selfless, like sacrificing some comfort so that a poor person won't go hungry, that's just because the person has a refined, well-trained conscience that will cause personal suffering for its owner if some more obviously selfish action is taken.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/70/70-h/70-h.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Read the essay online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3seCmEy" target="_blank"&gt;buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/59547537"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on "What Is Love?" (1992). We go through Badiou's account of love as the resolution of the paradox that on the one hand, Truth is trans-positional, which means there's no separate "man's truth" and "woman's truth" (or any other division like that), yet the positions of man and woman are "entirely disjunct." Badiou puts this in terms of a "humanity function," where people engaging in truth procedures like love thereby get counted as part of Humanity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We consider the extent to which Badiou's mathematical language is merely metaphor (it's not) and look at Badiou's comments about alleged gender differences, why he insists that the two perspectives are entirely distinct. One way that Badiou is not like someone espousing archetypical male and female spirits is that he doesn't consider these to exist prior to love itself. Love creates sexual difference, and sexual difference creates love; we have no reason to prioritize (chronologically or ontologically) one of these over the other.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Next episode: &lt;/strong &gt;"What Is Man?" by Mark Twain.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Instead, according to Badiou, there is originally &lt;em &gt;no overlap &lt;/em &gt;between the male and female positions. Those sets of experiences are like two non-overlapping sets. But all sets have in common the empty set, which is something we actually experience as a void, an emptiness. (There's definitely some Lacan coming in here; we went into Lacan's theory that "there is no sexual relationship" which Badiou pivots off here in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-169-analyzing-52068386"&gt;our discussion of the film &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-169-analyzing-52068386"&gt;Vertigo &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.) Love subtracts that void by giving us this new type of vision. You are not alone.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is this just a bunch of nonsense, this attempt to connect mathematical terminology (set theory, subtraction) with psychology to make ontology, i.e. a new structure (the Two) in the world that generates truths? Badiou stresses that love is not just a feeling in our individual consciousnesses, but actually adds something inter-personal to the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Love is something that necessarily starts with some element of risk, and is not necessarily quiescent. But it posits itself as enduring, as watching out for us as time rolls forward. Badiou describes it as a declaration of eternity. We know that it won't actually be eternal (for whatever reason), but we're not lying. "Happiness is proof that time can accommodate eternity."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A lot of our puzzlement about Badiou's view concerns how literally to take the claim that male and female consciousness do not overlap. He stresses that these are not literal genders, but just roles, so that someone who identifies as male could have the female role and vice versa. Still, there is definitely a "women are from Venus, men are from Mars" sort of thing going on here, which seems archaic and wrong.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He's not &lt;em &gt;just &lt;/em &gt;talking about every single person's existential isolation from every other person being overcome by gaining some sort of shared world of ideas and viewpoints through extended conversation. Literal nakedness as vulnerability is also part of it: we try to share ourselves totally.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This sharing, again, does not literally transmit one person into another, but instead opens us up to the truth of difference. It enables us to better understand that separation between people. This is foundational for being a member of a healthy, pluralistic society. It, along with the truths from the other truth procedures (politics, art and science), is what make us fully human. It's what enables philosophical Truth to be "generic," i.e. graspable by everyone, despite this complete difference between people's varying perspectives. Grasping philosophy requires that we in some sense "get out of our own heads," and love allows us to do this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Badiou insists that his position is different than Levinas' command to grasp the Other as Other, which is maybe more a matter of hands-off respect, and still focused on the change in viewpoint for each individual. Badiou has a more intimate type of knowledge in mind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The new material for this episode was all optional.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Between our Badiou episodes, we talk about potential future philosophy of science episodes (Polanyi? Hempel? Maxwell? Pickering's &lt;em &gt;Constructing Quarks &lt;/em &gt;? Hawking?) and philosophy of mathematics episodes. A bit on Badiou's "On Subtraction," that was suggested for our coverage but isn't going in either of our episodes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Then we talk sobriety, things our sponsors send us, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3E9ULWA" target="_blank"&gt;The Elegance of the Hedgehog &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, Engels on property, and wet vs. dry science.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/58990290"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;Conditions &lt;/em &gt;(1992), Ch. 1 "The (Re)turn of Philosophy Itself." What makes philosophy possible? Well, there are truths, and these come out of the four "conditions," i.e. mathematics (and science more generally), politics, art, and love. This precludes skepticism about truth. Because there are many truths, Badiou's philosophy is pluralistic, but these truths can be combined in thought, i.e. into a philosophy, so in that sense Truth is One, not many. This doesn't mean that you can gather all the truths together into one Truth and then be a dogmatic jerk about it. What philosophy does instead in this "bringing together" is not altogether clear, given that he doesn't want to be strictly negative and skeptical (this seems to be Wes' reading). Perhaps the point is pragmatic and humanist: Philosophy somehow makes these truths live for us, and so makes us more lively and human.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A possible connection to make here is to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-80-heidegger-27508261"&gt;Heidegger's "humanism,"&lt;/a &gt;which identified the purpose of philosophy as "disclosing the clearing of Being," in other words removing us from the mass of the everyday ("knowledge" for Badiou) so that we can confront and react to the truly novel and authentic, i.e. truths as emergent from what Badiou calls events. Philosophy provides a reflective space (an "interval" or "void") that provides perspective on the individual truths different from what the person actually falling in love or engaged in a scientific discovery or creating a work of art would have.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get into more of Badiou's "pincer" metaphor for philosophy: One of the arms is the "regulating of successiveness by argument" (i.e. reason), and the other is "the declaration at a limit." So philosophy on the one hand breaks out of the regularity of mere knowledge, i.e. inverts the succession of events that make up ordinary life. In this sense it is a "fiction of knowledge" as Badiou puts it. Saying that (for instance, as Descartes does) that mind and body are fundamentally separate ontological entities is a different kind of claim than saying something empirical about the relations that we note between mind and body in either an everyday setting (like that I will my arm to move and it does) or a scientific setting (like when a subject reports thinking of his mother and the neurologist notes a correlated activation of certain neurons). The ontological claim is not scientific; it can't be verified or refuted by experiment. It's like knowledge, but not.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The other side of the pincer is the limit, and maybe this is like the Kantian limit between the phenomena that science studies and the noumena, which are the way things are in themselves apart from normal knowledge. The ontological claim (or any philosophical claim) is going beyond the limits of normal discourse and knowledge. This is a "fiction of art," according to Badiou's language, in that I'd be using metaphor instead of argument to describe something transcendent, just like art does.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the two pincers are rational argumentation and artistic imagination, seizing the truth and so making it seize us, i.e. we're dazzled by it, like we're having a seizure. (Badiou refers to that double meaning of "seizure" there: grabbing and having a fit. Presumably the double meaning is retained in French!) So Truth is not a foundation of truths, but the "pincers of Truth" enable us to grasp and behold truths.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our official reading also included chapters 2 and 3 of the book. While ch. 2 is really just a short summary of his theory of truth (a recap), ch. 3, "What Is a Philosophical Institution," is about the what kind of academic organization a philosophy department should be given his idiosyncratic definition of philosophy. It should not be dogmatic, dedicated to reigning in the excesses of its faculty. It should serve as a "knot" to provide a unity of purpose: It should be open to all students, all about connecting thinkers with disciples, and a publishing house. The key here is the difference between multiplicity (which Badiou agrees with) and relativity (which he does not). The community of thinkers needs to be engaging with each other, not a hands-off "anything goes" plurality of "diverse" thinkers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Conditions &lt;/em &gt;(1992), Ch. 1 "The (Re)turn of Philosophy Itself," featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Badiou is arguing against contemporary post-structuralist French philosophers like Derrida and Foucault whom he characterizes as denying the existence of truth. Philosophy as a profession has consequently devolved into just being a history of philosophy. Post-structuralists, along with Nietzsche and Wittgenstein among others, play the same role for philosophy now as the sophists did for Plato: Sophists are essential in any age to give philosophy a conversation partner against which it can argue for the positive Truth that comes out of the individual truths of what Badiou calls philosophy's "truth conditions," which are politics, art, science (including mathematics), and love.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So it's not philosophy itself that generates truths, and in fact when it thinks it does, then we get "disaster": the type of dogmatism that led to Stalinism and Nazism. Badiou also distinguishes truths from knowledge, which is routinized, part of something considered established and communicated around. A truth instead emerges through an "event," which is something unexpected, inspirational, special... Essentially something that can't actually be articulated, yet we try to do so anyway. Think about a political revolution, an artistic creation, an act of falling in love, a startling scientific discovery: All these can be events, as described in Badiou's previous book &lt;em &gt;Being and Event &lt;/em &gt;(1988).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So why would we need philosophy if these other activities actually generate truths? Philosophy weaves them together into a unified vision of the world, which is something we need in order to be fully human. Philosophy lets us "think truths as compossible," i.e. existing together. Contra Wittgenstein, who famously said, “whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent,” Badiou claims that philosophy exactly tries to speak about what can't strictly be spoken about. He regards &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-74-jacques-17046792"&gt;Jacques Lacan &lt;/a &gt;as his master, and from Lacan we get the idea of the "real," which is the unarticulated residue between language, something that's of vital psychological importance. Badiou refers to "the void" as where Truth resides, and philosophy's role is not to fill that void (again, that would result in dogmatism), but to use that void to sustain philosophy as the "pincers of Truth" that grab individual truths and bring them together. Philosophy, Badiou insists, is "subtractive," in that Truth is subtracted from the labyrinth of meaning, kind of like when a sculptors say they create a thing by cutting away everything that is is not that thing. So the sophists put out arguments, definitions, metaphors -- the whole philosophers' toolkit -- and the philosopher stakes out the truth by subtracting from the sophists' positions, showing how they don't make sense and thereby pointing to something better.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are you bewildered by this language? So are we! Our goal in this episode is to try to decode all this terminology in order to then in ep. 282 explain what Badiou has to say about one of the particular conditions, love (described in ch. 11 of this same book).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3x7h0cH" target="_blank"&gt;Purchase &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3x7h0cH" target="_blank"&gt;Conditions &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://pdfcoffee.com/qdownload/alain-badiou-conditions-pdf-free.html" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.

Wes wants to learn new languages as an adult, and we all convey what we've done in that respect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Should we do more philosophy of science? Maybe Donna Haraway, i.e. feminist philosophy of science? We anticipate our next episode on Badiou and why we're not having a guest for it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth gets us going on audiobooks, and we anticipate &lt;em &gt;Dune &lt;/em &gt;(which will be covered on Pretty Much Pop) and &lt;em &gt;The Last Duel &lt;/em &gt;(which Pretty Much Pop just released an episode on).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Given that according to F., epistemological conformity (getting with the scientific program) can't proceed by an unambiguous appeal to reason, how does it proceed? Through indoctrination, propaganda, and coercion. Even when we want a free, rational society, we don't get this through reasoning with children and then citizens, but we have to use extra-rational means.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Do we really agree with F. that there are no recognizable standards of rationality that are independent of particular conceptual schemes or scientific theories?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Against Method &lt;/em &gt;(1975), the introduction through ch. 5 and ch. 15-16, featuring Dylan, Wes, and Seth. This book that began as a joint call-and-response project with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/10/23/ep280-1-lakatos-scientific-progress-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our last author Imre Lakatos &lt;/a &gt;, but then Lakatos died and couldn't respond to what Feyerabend explicitly wrote roughly in the form of a series of letters to a friend.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Feyerabend agreed with much of Lakatos' analysis of how science progresses but denied that this progress should be described as rational and that it can be captured via any single method of advancement. Through lots of case studies of brilliant scientists, F. tries to show that these figures violated any rules that philosophers of science have identified. It's not that F. thought that there was truly no rationality to their genius, or that any way of doing science is just as good as any other way, but he thought instead that the measures they took were so divergent and dependent on individual circumstances that if one had to look at all of them and generalize to a single scientific method, then the overall theme would have to be "anything goes."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So F. was trying to break more thoroughly from Popper than Lakatos did, with a resulting view that's more like Thomas Kuhn's, agreeing with Kuhn that there's no way to critique a scientific enterprise from within that enterprise, because any new, potentially countervailing evidence can be discounted from within the system. Each system involves a conceptual scheme and can't break out of that.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Like Lakatos (and Popper), F. had strong political motivations for his views, and felt that any pressure to conform to an existing system negatively impacts freedom. Scientists need to just engage problems as they see them and not pay attention to extraneous considerations (like "that's impossible according to current theories") that would end up impeding progress. In the abstract then, this sounds like it would not (as Popper was concerned about) rule out "pseudo-science" in advance, because there's no principled rule for distinguishing science from pseudo-science across the board. Instead, even the most crazy-sounding old theories (flat Earth, voodoo, the Genesis creation story, etc.) may have a grain of truth that can be usefully consulted or revised or serve as the inspiration for a future, predictively fruitful explanation. More practically, it's not justified, for instance, for us to categorically dismiss non-Western medical techniques just because they're not part of what has been approved by what we take to be scientific medicine. Particular alleged remedies need to be evaluated individually; we may well find that the ancients (or foreigners, or something otherwise outside of the accepted mainstream) knew something we've lost. Our knowledge and our culture more generally need a generous helping of epistemic anarchy to thrive.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does this really constitute a distinct, positive position between Kuhn and Lakatos? Or is F's book just a screed against doing philosophy of science at all as opposed to merely learning the history of science? We at PEL certainly use something like this principle in thinking about the history of philosophy, finding it useful to explore often archaic views with which we as moderns fundamentally disagree not just for their intrinsic interest but because we feel that looking at these brilliant weirdos from the past may give some useful, historically removed perspective on philosophical problems as they are currently conceived.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes brings up &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/05/28/ep191-conceptual-schemes-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our past discussion of Donald Davidson &lt;/a &gt;on conceptual schemes that might be useful for you to review.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3BRklgV" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/7/7e/Feyerabend_Paul_Against_Method.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this version online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite our now having released both Aristotle and Lakatos, this is an aftershow to our Bell episode, specifically talking more about the essay we discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-278-derrick-56654043"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;,  "The Rules of Racial Standing." What kind of discourse is Bell's recitation of these "rules" that he's observed in whose speech tends to make a political impact?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In that discussion, John McWhorter came up briefly, and if you want his view, maybe listen to the &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/265-religion-anti-racism/" target="_blank"&gt;recent Sam Harris interview with him &lt;/a &gt;. A key point in that interview was John's point that when we see a disparity (e.g. de facto segregated school districts) and pronounce "that's racist," we are missing the correct tense: We should say "that WAS racist," because yes, the situation got this way (often) because of explicitly racist policies of the past, but that doesn't mean that there are racist individuals now running these programs, making the situation worse. John objects to the personalization of the charges of racism and the terror that this has incited.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To respond (so I don't feel the need to do this in the NEXT Nightcap): I think the novelty of critical race theory (as represented by what we read in Bell) is exactly the depersonalization of charges of racism. To be anti-racist is to be actively working to reverse the damage that past explicit racism wrought. To fail to meet that challenge is to live contentedly within situations formed (in part) by racism. To call anyone in that latter category a racist is a rhetorical strategy that is purposefully provocative, like calling anyone who does not sacrifice all other priorities to increased GDP a socialist. But despite our meme culture, I don't think there's any danger of us losing sight through this increased charge of racism of the difference between mere apathy and neo-Nazism. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The rhetoric assumes that we as a mass do NOT identify ourselves as racists in the latter sense and challenges us to live up to that belief. It is not supposed to a divisive condemnation, but a call to take on this difficult and fundamentally economic problem, the solving of which does not just mean cultural deference to black voices or paying reparations to the descendants of slaves (though there's a place for both of those things), but by augmenting the social safety net and promoting a more egalitarian society though increased investment in the commons.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;By insisting as John does that "this WAS racism," he's encouraging complacency: that these problems don't need solving, that now that racist decision-making has largely been removed from institutions, we just need to let individual efforts gradually (over generations) work out the discrepancies in achievement.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dylan recommends Count Me In, Mark talks about Dune, and Seth is probably still reading something about genocide. Wes didn't reply quickly enough on Slack and so isn't on this one, which is fine because he wasn't on the Bell episode, and seems determined to avoid these liberal political theory episodes, which means we probably won't do all that many of them, which is why we have to talk about such things (if we want to talk about them at all) on Nightcap.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/10/23/ep280-1-lakatos-scientific-progress-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Part One &lt;/a &gt;on "Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes" (1970).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We try to clarify the difference between dogmatic falsificationism, the view commonly attributed to Karl Popper whereby a disconfirming experiment is taken to definitively refute a scientific theory, with methodological falsificationism, which is what Lakatos attributes to Popper.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A methodological falsificationist does not uncritically accept all the background assumptions behind an experiment, e.g. that the measurements employed in the experiment don't themselves have faulty theory built into them (what if telescopes simply didn't work the way Galileo thought?). But for the purposes of a particular experiment, the scientist provisionally accepts all those background assumptions as true, and so only proves the hypothetical "If the background assumptions are true, then the experiment disproves the theory." Scientists can of course later examine those background assumptions, but the conflict involved in a particular experiment is still (potentially) between that experiment and the theory it's setting out to test.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lakatos claims, on the contrary, the conflict is always triangular: between the experiment, the theory that it's testing, and a potential replacement theory. If you don't have another possible theory at hand that would better explain the experimental results, then there's in practice no justification to reject the old theory, as opposed to just continuing to puzzle over the anomalous results, perhaps trying to refine the background assumptions that produced them, perhaps just accepting them as an anomaly to live with (like other anomalies that no doubt exist and have been acknowledged as ongoing problems with whatever theory we're talking about). Lakatos calls his view "sophisticated methodological falsificationism."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get more about Lakatos' positive account of research programs: Each of these involves negative heuristics, which are directives on what investigations to avoid, i.e. ones that would conflict with the hard core of the theory. So materialistic science discourages research into psychic phenomena that would fundamentally conflict with its core tenets. A research program also involves positive heuristics, which are directives about what will be worthwhile to study. Scientists aren't just reacting to potentially troubling observations; the program provides a roadmap for figuring out what new facts the theory should predict. What are the surprising implications of the theory?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The later portions of Lakatos' essay are largely taken up by case studies, e.g. Niels Bohr's development of his model of the atom. We're very glad to have Dylan, our resident physics Ph.D. on the podcast!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes" (1970), featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth. In what way is scientific progress rational? To understand the state of the debate by Lakatos' time, let's run quickly through some history of the philosophy of science:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Early scientists like Francis Bacon saw science as providing certainty in the progressive accumulation of truths. In the 1930s, Karl Popper argued that while experiments cannot prove a scientific theory to be true, they can and do falsify theories, again with certainty: Science proceeds through a series of creative conjectures that are then refuted by experiments, leading scientists to further conjectures that are more accurate, i.e. not refuted by the experiments undertaken to that point. Thomas Kuhn argued in the 1960s that this was nonsense: When a supposedly falsifying experiment is performed against a theory, the theory is not typically given up; adherents of the theory instead just ignore the experimental results as an anomaly. Science on Kuhn's view is a series of paradigms (world-views that include ways of doing science including for determining what counts as admissible results), and why one paradigm goes out of fashion to be replaced by another is a matter for sociological study with no ultimate rationality behind it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lakatos' view was somewhere between Popper's and Kuhn's: He accepted Kuhn's charge that scientists have not historically given up their theories as soon as a refuting experiment comes along, but he nonetheless claimed like Popper than scientific progress is rational, and so we can study it by studying the logic of justification and not just the sociology of intellectual fashion. Instead of talking about paradigms, Lakatos uses the term "research program." Each scientific research program has a firm set of core principles that are resistant to change by experiment, but also includes numerous auxiliary principles that can be changed. An extensively considered example in the text is Newtonian mechanics, which even when it was developed could not explain the motion of the moon. When some particular orbit seemed to defy Newton's laws, people did not give up those laws, but would instead posit that there must be some other body out there distorting that planet's motion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The rationality of a scientific research program is determined by how "progressive" it is, which according to Lakatos is its ability to continually make new and unexpected predictions. If a program makes a false prediction, well, that's not enough reason to just give it up, but enough false predictions necessitating ad hoc modifications of auxiliary principles mean that the program is "regressive." A scientist working within that program could still rationally keep working on it to try to make it more progressive, but at least in historical hindsight, we can tell a rational story about how Newtonian mechanics explained the world better than Aristotelianism, and how Einstein improved on Newton, etc.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3jttLc6" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book that contains this essay &lt;/a &gt;(and we also read the intro from 1973 from this collection of papers) or &lt;a href="https://dl1.cuni.cz/pluginfile.php/730446/mod_resource/content/2/Imre%20Lakatos%3B%20Proofs%20and%20Refutations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Audio editing by &lt;a href="https://pixelboxaudio.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tyler Hislop &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/10/09/ep279-1-aristotle-categories-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on the &lt;em &gt;Categories &lt;/em &gt;, we finish up our discussion of substance by talking about artifacts: Only "genuine unities" are substances, and hammers and cups, for Aristotle, don't count as such unities. Should being a cup be considered instead a property like being white? Can properties be complex?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're actually not sure about natural objects like rivers, mountains, etc. Are these natural unities, or just a way we cut up the world that is useful to us? We have more questions than answers!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One tool Aristotle provides for decoding this is to ask about the relation between an individual and the definition of its descriptor. So if Socrates is an individual person, and the definition of person is, as Aristotle says, "a rational animal," then Socrates is a rational animal. Let's say Socrates is also white, and the definition of white is "the lightest color," well, Socrates isn't a color at all, so this shows that saying someone is a person is a different kind of attribution than saying someone is white.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, this may not actually work. If I say Socrates is wet, then the definition of wet can be just given as "having a lot of moisture," and sure, that still describes the wet Socrates. The difference is that I didn't say that wetness is "a state of having a lot of moisture," in which case I could say that no, Socrates is not a state.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To return to the examples above that we use in the episode, why not define white instead of as "a color that..." (e.g. reflects light at such and such a wavelength; we're not sure what kind of definition Aristotle would actually give) but as "having the quality of..." And yes, a white Socrates has the quality of reflecting the light or whatever. Conversely, if instead of defining person as "rational animal," we define person as "a species within the genus animal distinguished by the differentia rational," then no, Socrates is not a species. So this tool that Aristotle spends such time on to justify genus and species as being secondary substances while other descriptors are properties doesn't actually work.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is just one of many interpretive puzzles that this text suggests.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the &lt;em &gt;Categories &lt;/em &gt;(ca. 350 BCE), which purports to describe all the types of entities that exist. The participants are Mark, Wes, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The most important of these Categories is substance, a term which primarily picks out individual natural things (a particular person, animal, plant, or material) and secondarily picks out the kinds that group those things (e.g. the species person and its genius animal). The rest of the categories (quality, quantity, relative, where, when, being-in-a-position, having, doing, and being affected) are all types of being rely on their being substances.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So why does Aristotle break down the world the way he does (in this text; note that he actually has a very different notion of substance in his presumably later account in the &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;)? Why are species descriptions "secondary substances" instead of qualities? What makes for a substance (the Greek word translated as substance literally just means "being"), and how do qualities and the rest of the categories actually relate to these substances? Aristotle's use of the term "relative" instead of "relation" (which sounds like things insofar as they are related instead of the relation) gives us a possible hint that he may actually still be talking about substances when talking about the rest of the categories, like substances are all that exist, but there are different aspects of substances we can focus on, different ways in which we can apprehend them. So if you take a single person (say Socrates), there are many types of things one can say about him at any given time; what are those types?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A complicating issue is the structure of the text: All the consideration of the categories is in the middle part of the text (The "Predicamenta"), and it's debated why the parts before and after that are actually part of this text at all. So we start near the beginning (in the "Pre-Predicamenta") considering how entities might be "present in" or "said of" other entities. Universals are said of substances, so for instance Socrates is a person and Socrates is wet. Accidental properties are present in substances:  If Socrates is wet, then there's wetness in him, both in the sense that there's an individual instance of wetness in him and thereby they universal wetness is also in him, if that makes sense. However, since personhood is not an accidental property but the essence of Socrates, then while personhood is said of Socrates, there's no personhood in Socrates. The individual Socrates is according to this terminology neither in nor said of anything else, and that's what makes it a primary substance: It's a self-subsistent entity, not relying on other entities to exist.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can probably see places in this scheme that later thinkers might object to. Is there really such a difference in the dependent existence of a substance vs. a property? Yes, Aristotle seems right (contra Plato) that there can be no "wetness" without something in the world that is wet, but it's also true that everything existent has some level of wetness or other, even if that level is zero, and so in that sense every substance relies on every property. This might be easier to see with color or shape: Surely colors and shape don't exist independently of colored objects, but all objects have some color and shape or other.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle's special treatment of species and genus as secondary substances is also very strange. Why insist that there's an individual instance of wetness (what in our recent Hegel episode we called a "sensory particular") in wet objects, but not that there's an individual instance of personhood in all people? Isn't being a person just a bunch of properties like having a certain appearance and/or genetic make-up and/or behavior? Isn't that genetic make-up quite literally in the person? Isn't this distinction between "present in" and "said of" pretty strange and arbitrary?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There's also the related question of artifacts: Why is being a person a description of the substance of a thing but being a hammer is not? Something's being a hammer will have to be a relation of some substance to human intentions, meaning that there are not literally hammers, but there are things that we use as hammers, and so presumably on Aristotle's account we'd have to give a description of something's being a hammer in terms of its being affected in some way, but Aristotle tells us almost nothing about those latter categories like affection in this text, so there's no real way we can tell.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the &lt;em &gt;Metaphysics &lt;/em &gt;, we'll move to Aristotle's more famous view that an individual is not the basic kind of thing, but that every individual has form and matter, so that the "personhood" would be the form, and this particular flesh is the matter of Socrates. Even this view is quite different than our modern view that the basic components of things are the smallest bits, whether they be elements or atoms or quarks or super-strings, or what have you. Why insist that the ways in which it's useful for us to break up the world for common-sense purposes are metaphysically basic? A common interpretation of the &lt;em &gt;Categories &lt;/em &gt;is that it's both an analysis of the basic types of things and an analysis of parts of speech, because the world as it is independent of our minds is exactly isometric to the world as we perceive and talk about it. Why would we want to make that assumption?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3AsllYe" target="_blank"&gt;Get the J.L.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/09/27/ep278-1-derrick-bell-racism-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;Faces At the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism &lt;/em &gt;(1992), with guest &lt;a href="https://lawrence-ware.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Ware &lt;/a &gt;. We discuss mainly "The Racial Preference Licensing Act" (ch. 3), "Divining a Racial Realism Theory" (ch. 5), and "The Rules of Racial Standing" (ch. 6).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The first of these essays plays with an idea (attributed to his fictional alter ego Geneva Crenshaw) that since businesses continue to discriminate (in hiring if not in excluding clientele), maybe we should license the activity, so a business that wants to be racist will have to a) declare it, b) be &lt;em &gt;consistently &lt;/em &gt;racist, and c) pay into a reparations fund, e.g. to black educational institutions. Would such a proposal actually deal more honestly with this intractable problem?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ch. 5 depicts him debating a different fictional character, the gun-toting Erika Wechsler who meets the description of today's Antifa. Her "racial realism" is an excuse to compare today's situation with regard to the failure of civil rights laws to achieve desired effects to the arguments of legal realists in 1930s who objected to the classical structure of law as formal group of "common law" rules. Clearly during the Great Depression, circumstances required government to go beyond its usual role to meet human need, yet conservative courts could not interpret the Constitution to allow these necessary actions to take place.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, ch. 6 discusses the political rhetoric as it applies to race: Blacks' accounts of racial discrimination inevitably are thought of as requiring white support or need to be "taken with a grain of salt," since black people are interpreted as biased in this area. The exception is when a black person speaks out against other blacks, at which point whites amplify that voice. Finally, whenever a black speaker says something that upsets white people, whites demand that all other black figures denounce the offending speaker.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Faces At the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism &lt;/em &gt;(1992), a foundational text in critical race theory that presents stories and essays related chiefly to the philosophy of law. &lt;a href="https://lawrence-ware.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Ware &lt;/a &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/?s=lawrence+ware" target="_blank"&gt;returns &lt;/a &gt;to talk with Mark, Seth, and Dylan about "The Space Traders."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is racism, and how can we measure its acuity? Bell thinks that an argument that racism in America has not come to an end needs no philosophical argument: It's reflected obviously and directly in the data about disparities in wealth and quality of life.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why are these disparities evidence of racism? To a racist, they might not seem so, as such a person can blame the quality of black characters and culture. But granting that all people are as aggregates more or less inherently equal, i.e. by denying racist assumptions, it seems reasonable to conclude that current disparities are a result of the legacy of slavery, and Bell adds to this a few ideas of his own about the continuing role of black people in American class relations: The rich and powerful them as a buffer against widespread rebellion among poor white workers. If the latter can at least point to someone and claim superiority (i.e. they look down at the black "faces at the bottom of the well"), someone they can blame for all of society's ills, this distracts from the real source of their oppression, i.e. capitalism. This is a chief reason why Bell regarded racism as permanent: It will last as long as our current economic system does. To actually address racial disparities would require substantial income redistribution away from the distribution of wealth that capitalism has given us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This "racial realism" is hostile to merely symbolic remedies for racism. People merely being more respectful, celebrating Martin Luther King Day, and otherwise paying lip service to equality doesn't correct the disparities that are at the heart of racist cycles. Even if a "talented tenth" of people of color rise to positions of influence, so long as the mass of black people are impoverished, then they will be the target and source of most crime. The presence of those like Bell himself who have "risen" makes the judgment of white people on the rest that much more damning: Clearly there must be plenty of opportunity if such rising is possible! Being "racially blind" just ensures continuation of the status quo. Any laws requiring equal treatment will fail if racist sentiments and preferences are widespread. Opportunity and honors are most doled out according to "who you know," i.e. systems that are not necessarily racist in their intent but have definitely perpetuated racial disparities.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Bell claimed that white people as a group are incapable of sympathizing with the plight of black people, and this has been shown time and again in political bargains that sacrifice black interests, starting with the American Constitution, where the acute necessity for unification caused concessions to slave owners. The Brown vs. the Board of Education court decision was supposed to be the landmark that would solve segregation in one swoop, but lax enforcement and subsequent court decisions gutting its force have left de facto segregation in place in many schools. Besides which, even if a law says that schools can no longer be segregated, this doesn't prevent "white flight" from urban areas to white-dominated school districts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"The Space Traders," the final chapter of the book, is a science fiction story wherein aliens come to Earth during a time of economic and environmental catastrophe (the inevitable outcome of laissez faire capitalism) offering to solve all of our problems if only we give up the American black population to them, to be taken up into space to an unspecified fate. Bell posits that after due consideration, white America would take the deal, claiming that any group of Americans should be patriotic enough to sacrifice themselves for their fellows, but characters in the story claim that if the aliens were asking for all white women, or redheads, or any other segment of the population, we'd tell them to go to hell. Bell's thesis is that black people are only given rights when it's in the interests of the white majority to do so, as when after World War II it would have looked especially bad for us to not provide a sharp contrast to those racist Nazis, especially with so many American black veterans. It was important for us to look free as compared to the Communists. But as soon as times get tough, when there is economic uncertainty or hardship, black welfare is sacrificed first.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ALJ32C" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/UpOJzIvmCCk" target="_blank"&gt;Watch the &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/UpOJzIvmCCk" target="_blank"&gt;Space Traders &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/UpOJzIvmCCk" target="_blank"&gt;short film.&lt;/a &gt;Bell's previous book that we mention that focuses more on specific court cases and such is &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3kKXX3i" target="_blank"&gt;And We Are Not Saved: The Elusive Quest for Racial Justice &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1989).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="https://www.josephwatsonart.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Joseph Watson &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://prettymuchpop.com/2020/07/08/pmp51-illustrations/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to him talk about art on Pretty Much Pop &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Audio editing by &lt;a href="https://pixelboxaudio.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tyler Hislop &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Here you go!&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Psychologist Dave Pizarro of the &lt;a href="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/" target="_blank"&gt;Very Bad Wizards &lt;/a &gt;joins us to discuss Stanley Milgram's "Behavioral Study of Obedience" (1963; &lt;a href="https://www.birdvilleschools.net/cms/lib/TX01000797/Centricity/Domain/1013/AP%20Psychology/milgram.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it &lt;/a &gt;), Philip Zimbardo’s "Interpersonal Dynamics in a Simulated Prison" (1973; &lt;a href="http://pdf.prisonexp.org/ijcp1973.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it &lt;/a &gt;), and John Doris’s "Persons, Situations, and Virtue Ethics" (1998).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Do difficult situations make good people act badly? Are there really "good" and "bad" people, or are we all about the same, but put in different situations? Situationism is supported by Milgram's experiment, where most subjects could be easily pressured into delivering shocks to an innocent person (really an actor… punked!). A more immersive example was provided by The Stanford Prison Experiment, where students took on the roles of guard and prisoner, and quickly became sadistic and passive respectively. John Doris argues that situationism is a direct attack on virtue ethics, that really there is no such thing as a virtue like "bravery" or "generosity" that cuts across all sorts of situations. While there are of course consistent personality traits, these don't map against the virtues as depicted by Aristotle and our common cultural notions. Rather, they're more context-dependent, specific to certain types of situations.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;David and his pal Tamler Sommers previously discussed situationism back in &lt;a href="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/9" target="_blank"&gt;Very Bad Wizards ep. 9 &lt;/a &gt;.

So I've done some minimal processing on the Hegel seminar I gave on Aug. 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-275-hegels-in-54314143"&gt;first episode &lt;/a &gt;in this Summer of Hegel we read the Preface and the Introduction but only actually talked about the Introduction, while the Preface is much wilder, encompassing more of the scope of Hegel's project. So I was itching to talk use some of my Preface-prep-time and so held this Close Reading as a pay-to-enter, supporter-only seminar over Zoom with about 25 people. I'm presenting this to you unedited, as I'm really not sure how good it was as a recorded product and did not want to put further time into it. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Even in this seminar we didn't get through the whole Preface. You can look at &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/marks-hegel-for-55011437"&gt;my notes &lt;/a &gt;for some paraphrases of the missing sections.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Let me know if you might want me to do more of these, and you can take this as fulfillment of our ill-advised promise at your support level to hold regular AMAs. We've actually removed that promise now from the description of this tier, but Seth at some point said he'd be willing to hold one of these, so feel free to go ahead and send questions to him that you'd like him to address via email: seth@partiallyexaminedlife.com.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;-Mark Linsenmayer &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth, Wes and Dylan re-introduce &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/04/02/ep35-hegel-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;this episode from ten years ago &lt;/a &gt;on G.F.W. Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;, Ch. 4A "Self-Consciousness," which features guest Tom McDonald.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We've removed the "review" section of the old episode (the first half), because it's duplicative of our recent &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/08/01/ep275-1-hegel-phenomenology-of-spirit/" target="_blank"&gt;three-episode run &lt;/a &gt;on this book. The old discussion thus picks up in the book right where &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/08/29/ep277-1-hegel-physics-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 277 &lt;/a &gt;leaves off.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can of course just listen to the new intro and jump right to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/04/02/ep35-hegel-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;the full version of the old episode instead &lt;/a &gt;, and follow that up immediately by listening to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/04/10/ep36-hegel-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 36 &lt;/a &gt;, which this new introduction also discusses.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what happens in ch. 4? Hegel has established that an understanding of the world as objective is only possible because the being-for-self of objects (what Kant thought of as "things-in-themselves" is the same as their being-for-another, or specifically at this point their being-for-us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So we're led by this reasoning to want to take ourselves as objects in order to better understand how this all works. As with the other stages, the initial move is an apparently immediate grasp of self, as &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/05/13/episode-2-descartess-meditations-what-can-we-know/" target="_blank"&gt;Descartes' &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/05/13/episode-2-descartess-meditations-what-can-we-know/" target="_blank"&gt;Meditations &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;/em &gt;described. But of course this immediacy turns out to be an illusion, and by the end we'll see (and explore in &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/04/10/ep36-hegel-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 36 &lt;/a &gt;) how this apparently primary introspection actually only reveals something very superficial: only "I=I." What we really are concretely is something established through reflection over time, and this process of reflection begins only when we get an idea of who we are from other people.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The perception of the world is enough to get the idea of a self that exists over time to have these different experiences, but that doesn't really differentiate me from you from other people. It could be anyone having those experiences, as far as the structure of experience itself goes. How does the unity of self-consciousness with itself become something actually essential to self-consciousness (Hegel asks)? His answer is that self-consciousness is "desire in general." So you might have thought desire was an emotion or something else that we merely do, but for Hegel it's a structural property of experience.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is like for &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/01/01/ep87-sartre/" target="_blank"&gt;Sartre &lt;/a &gt;, consciousness is Nothingness; &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/05/30/episode-140-1-beauvoir/" target="_blank"&gt;Beauvoir &lt;/a &gt;describes it as ambiguity. In both cases, the point is that there's a vacuum that things tend to rush into, i.e. there's dynamic propensity to movement built right into the existence of consciousness. For consciousness to take itself as an object is not a state of self-reflection but an action, a movement: a desire for a more substantial self. When we try to reflect on ourselves, we see only the Humean singular point of consciousness in our experience of the moment. But that's not really the self; rather the self is that movement of reflection (this point comes right from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/07/17/ep274-1-schelling-self-consciousness-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Schelling &lt;/a &gt;). So the attempt at self-consciousness is frustrated; we can't actually see the part that's doing the seeing (i.e. what we think abstractly must be the self). We need some sort of resource outside of this insular, Cartesian experience of self-reflection: something like a mirror, but not so lifeless. As Hegel says, "the object of immediate desire is a living thing." We need another person to help us see ourselves, to feel actually real and meaningful.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's tricky here is that as we'll see see in the next section, having an identified desire also requires full self-consciousness, which requires other people. So it's not that before other people come along, we desire that they do so. This is not a psychological explanation but an ontological one: one about our being. Abstractly, if a being were to have merely a Cartesian sense of self-consciousness (and no one actually does this; Descartes' situation of contemplation is a purposeful abstraction of yourself from the outside world, pretending that it might even be possible that the outside world doesn't exist; remember that Hegel found this type of skepticism to be self-contradicting and so not worth taking seriously even for a minute), then there would be a lack that would need to be filled. So calling this "desire," when no human being has been in this situation and has had such a desire is pretty weird.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I mentioned an intervening step during: the movement from understanding physics in the previous chapter to understanding biology. We already had in understanding physics an idea of dynamism, e.g. the pull of gravity or magnetism, but with the advent of self-consciousness, the recognition that it's the self that holds together the entire experienced world, we get the idea of "life," which imputes to some of the objects we experience an independence that goes beyond the mere directionality of a physical process to a full-blown, flexibly enacted &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/12/28/ep130-1-aristotle-biology/" target="_blank"&gt;teleology &lt;/a &gt;. At the end of the discussion here I give my radical take on this, which is that Hegel is not merely bringing a traditional conception of biology into his explanation, but that this notion of "life" refers to anything that has the requisite complexity and apparently internal self-determination. Life in this sense would be a species of Spirit, which can refer to any complex system including a society. So Hegel is introducing this new, self-reflected structure in a way that will facilitate the political stories that take up much of the rest of this book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 8/16/21. Seth thinks about how to continue reading Hegel and some initial political ranting about Texas and gerrymandering ensues.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We think about what to read in aesthetics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of sport. (Update: the sport episode is not happening soon.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For the main event, we try to see what we can remember about the philosophy of emotions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, Seth reveals how his morbid interests affect ad reads, which transitions into talk about Devo. (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/xDS3lfsa8gE" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the video &lt;/a &gt;Seth is referring to with the treadmills.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/08/29/ep277-1-hegel-physics-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;our close reading of &lt;em &gt;The Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;(1807), ch. 3, "Force and the Understanding."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start off with the dynamic between the expressed and merely stored up aspects of force and how this relates to the forcing and the forced entities in the interaction. Which of these is the "solicitor" and which is being solicited? Either one can be seen as the solicitor; while it seems like you've got one object that goes out and exerts force on something else, it's really a symmetrical interaction, in that if you didn't have something providing resistance (and so holding on to its force internally), then you wouldn't have interaction at all; the forced is providing a medium for the expression of the forcer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The important move in this section is that we're now talking about something driving appearances which is beyond them, but yet only has its expression through appearances. Unlike in previous sections, we're not just talking about images in perception, but something posited as the source of images.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why is this "soliciting"/"solicited" distinction important for Hegel to undermine? Because it's essentially the distinction between form and content. Where for Kant, our mind comes equipped with forms (e.g. causality, number, space) which are then shaped by some content from a perceptual given (sense data), Hegel sees this interaction between mind and world as more symmetrical: It's not that the world exerts force on us and we receive these impressions and shape them, but that we're part of the system that is the world, and it's part of us. By doing science and so discovering things about the world, we're really dredging into the depths of our own minds.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hegel's goal here is to argue that the Kantian notion of the thing-in-itself doesn't work because if we posit such a thing, we realize that it has the same structure as the categories of the Understanding: it just &lt;em &gt;is &lt;/em &gt;the mind (the self), not something beyond the field of our experience that we can never grasp.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;(1807), ch. 3, "Force and the Understanding." What is "force" as physics describes it? And scientific law? Do these terms denote objects in the world, or models for how we describe the world?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Hegel, force is a way of talking about the metaphysical relation that one object has to other objects. Or taken from another perspective, it's the relations themselves that become objects for our understanding of the world. Hegel's position is a variation on Hume's account of causality, which said that causality is not a matter of one object in the world exerting some hidden power on another object in the world, but instead a pattern of always seeing one kind of thing (which we call effect) happen after another kind of thing (which we call cause). For Hegel, likewise, talking about force is a way of talking about how certain happenings strike us as always related to other happenings, such that a magnet, for instance, is defined by its having effects on metals and other magnets.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;More generally, Hegel develops the concept of force as a solution for how to describe how objects are individuated from each other at all. As discussed in our previous episode, if you say that an object is what it is because of its properties, that seems to undermine the unified character of that object: It becomes just a bundle of properties. By thinking instead of the relations between objects (i.e. extrinsic properties), we can consider each object as unified (as a One), but individuated by their position in a pattern of objects, or rather a pattern of events that involve (and so essentially create) these objects.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Grasping such a pattern requires the Understanding, i.e. abstract, conceptual thinking not tied closely to particular perceptions. We're not merely saying "this red I'm perceiving now is what it is because it is different from white and the other colors, and it's a color in that it's not a shape or texture or other sensory modality" to individuate a sensory property. We're going beyond this and explaining that color is a result of light of various wavelengths striking objects and hitting eyeballs, such that we can systematically say what the relation of colors are to each other and to other properties an object might have. A color becomes an action, an event. Something is impressing (forcing) its color onto my perception, and there are many force interactions in this grand pattern that don't result in perceptions at all, such that we can call the concepts involved "unconditioned universals," because the concepts aren't "conditioned" by our sensory apparatus. While of course we often see (or otherwise sense) the results of force (and wouldn't be talking about it at all were it not for our sensory experience), it us not like a particular patch of red or a particular sound but instead a general schema or theory about the interaction among the world's elements.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As this chapter proceeds, we move from talking about force (the individual relationships in this pattern) to talking about natural law (as a way of making generalizations about the pattern, and also as a way to refer to the pattern as a whole, i.e. the Law of Nature that makes everything move the way it does, to finally putting this back on the Understanding per Hegel as idealist: This pattern is not just something in nature, but something in the mind, because there's no sharp dividing line between nature and mind. Yes, as we discussed last time, we can be wrong about particular things in nature, but that's only because we're misaligning concepts (thinking that the pencil in water really is bent without understanding the forces that make it merely look bent), when the concepts and so the way we would resolve these illusions (taking the pencil out of the water and putting it back in until we've figured out the physical laws involved) are all ultimately furniture of our minds.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the idea that there is a Kantian "thing-in-itself," an inner nature of the experienced world that is forever beyond our experience, is actually a part of experience. The pattern presents itself as having depths, but of course with science, we peel into those depths and do, for instance, describe the inner workings of light and shape that account for the visible patterns of colors. But even as we do this, that explanation presents itself as having further depths that we don't yet understand. While for Kant, scientific discoveries are all within that veil of phenomena that forever lies over the true, inner world, for Hegel, the world presents itself as more like an onion with no inner layer at all, just more depths for us to potentially plumb. So saying that this is "all in our minds" is not to say we all just make it up like a dream, but that we only have experience insofar as we're creating structure, and it's this structure that science investigates. To further understand how this might work, we'd have to reflect our own minds, on self-consciousness and how it is in turn formed by social forces, which is exactly what the subsequent chapters of the book explore.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We quickly finish &lt;em &gt;The Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;(1807), ch. 1 "Sense Certainty" and then focus on ch. 2 "Perception." &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does Hegel's claim about the inadequacy of perceptual knowledge also indicate an incoherence in traditional metaphysical accounts? Since much of Hegel's emphasis in considering perception is the relationship between an object's various properties, it does look like phenomenology is supposed to tell us not just about how we should describe what we know, but about how the world could possibly be. As &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/12/27/ep259-locke-complex-ideas-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Locke &lt;/a &gt;pointed out, we don't have any direct experience of a bare, property-less substance that would then serve to house and unify all the properties, yet the idea of a mere bundle of properties that just hang around each other for no reason is also deeply unsatisfying.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A key point in this section (and throughout Hegel's book) is a determinate negation: For anything to emerge as a definite thing, it needs to be defined as &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;something else, which then set it in relation to that else, and these relations are therefore properties (i.e. parts) of the first thing. So you were trying to distinguish something, but in doing so, you've created a unity between the thing and its opposition. This is one way to describe the dialectic not just as a progression of theories about knowledge, but in a physical manifestation. So the various properties of, for instance, a heap of salt are related to each other in this sort of unified opposition. You might think (at the beginning of the Perception chapter) that you're perceiving a unified thing, which would mean that its Oneness makes it indifferent to its properties (meaning that even a change in properties wouldn't change which thing we're pointing out; remember, we're coming out of the sense-certainty chapter that was concerned with the alleged perception of and reference to a particular, and so in this section, we're still doing that, although we acknowledge that there are what Hegel calls "sensuous universals" involved), but because the properties end up actually related to each other after all, it must be the thing that's relating them, so it isn't actually a One but is a Many (a unity with the properties it relates).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ambiguity in what properties are actually associated with the thing I'm referring to allows us according to Hegel to talk about perceptual error. For instance, I thought I was looking at a horse, but it was just a picture of a horse, and so didn't have the three-dimensional shape (not to mention the liveliness) that I thought I perceived.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ultimately all vacillation in how we're understanding the objects we perceive leads according to Hegel to seeing the essence of that perception as being this movement within the mind, i.e. the vacillation, which means that perception involves not just direct contact with particulars, or indirect contact with them through sensuous universals, but it involves the Understanding and its abstract concepts ("unconditioned universals").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;(1807), ch. 1 "Sense Certainty" and ch. 2 "Perception." After introducing Hegel's project in &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/07/30/ep-275-1-hegel-phenomenology-of-spirit-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 275 &lt;/a &gt;, we now walk through the first two steps of his dialectic where he presents some basic theories of knowledge and shows why they're inaccurate.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The first of these is direct realism, the idea that perception is a simple matter of being directly exposed to particular things. On this view, we don't need to know what the thing is exactly, and we don't need to talk about it. We just sense it. Is this a reasonable view? Hegel says no: In trying to pick out what it is we're sensing (even nonverbally, just to ourselves), we have to use something like pointing, i.e. the concept of a "this." What goes into picking out a "this"? Well, we need a notion of "here" and one of "now," and all three of these notions on closer scrutiny are universals, meaning that they're general concepts that refer not just to that one thing you're trying to pick out, but to any number of instances of this, here and now. (The modern term for these concepts that vary systematically in meaning according to the circumstance of their utterance is "&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/indexicals/" target="_blank"&gt;indexicals &lt;/a &gt;.") We thought at the beginning of this "sense certainty" stage that there's really no philosophical problem to perception at all, and by the end we find that perception is going to require concepts, that there's really no such thing as just raw sense data that can then provide a foundation for perception.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second stage, we've admitted that there are concepts, but these concepts still function to pick out sensible particulars, like a particular piece of chalk in front of you. Is there something problematic about this idea of a conceptualized sensible particular? Well, yes, there's something paradoxical about the relation between this substance and its various properties. As Locke famously pointed out, we don't actually have a good idea of what this bare, propertyless substance might be at all. So is this substance really a One, a single object? Or is it an Also, i.e. a bundle of properties that sit together in this indefinite medium. By the end of the section, Hegel will posit that to make sense of this relation, we need the idea of "force," i.e. something unseen that captures the dynamic interplay between visible properties. We're no longer by that point talking about sensible particulars at all, but about events that we attribute to unseen forces like gravity and electromagnetism. We'll talk about that third (pretty complicated) step in the dialectic in our episode 277, which will serve to wrap up our treatment of this book (for the moment).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There are many more twists and turns in the argument than I've indicated here, but hopefully we walk through them step by step slowly enough in the discussion that you don't get lost. Given that Hegel is so steadfastly against the idea of merely summarizing philosophy as opposed to actually doing it, it's not surprising that it should be difficult to do so adequately here.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The secondary source Wes recommended was Peter Kalkavage's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3AydKaL" target="_blank"&gt;The Logic of Desire &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. Mark read some of Robert Solomon's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2U4WmuK" target="_blank"&gt;In the Spirit of Hegel &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/07/30/ep-275-1-hegel-phenomenology-of-spirit-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on the Introduction to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's big book (1807).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're up to section 81 now, getting more detail on what Hegel's goal in the book is and some of his basic terminology. He said that normally, we might think that in a philosophical investigation, there's some criteria for truth that is going to constitute the essence of that investigation. So for a scientist, are the experiments repeatable? Are the results potentially falsifiable (per Popper)? For an empiricist like Hume, is there some basic sense information that the alleged knowledge successfully can be broken down to? But for Hegel, any criteria like that is going to be a result of philosophy, not just something we can posit at the beginning in order to do philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Moreover, a general way of characterizing the kinds of criteria I mentioned above is to say that we judge the success of a theory by how well it corresponds with the world, but of course if the whole point of the enterprise is to figure out epistemology, and of course Hegel came out of a tradition of German Idealism, so we can't rely on some correspondence theory of truth to determine whether our theories are any good. Instead, Hegel's book evaluates theories of knowledge using criteria internal of those theories: Does this theory actually do what it claims to do? We end up comparing consciousness with itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This internal way of looking at theories yields an interesting vocabulary: Something considered via its essence, by what it is as opposed to how it's related to other things, is an "in-itself." There's truth involved there, in that the thing is what it is (corresponds to itself), but it's a pretty thin, merely "Notional" truth. (Notion = Concept, not that that's helpful. It is something preliminary; Wes says in our podcast that it's like a blueprint.) Insofar as we're considering something's relation to us or to other things, it's a "for-another." (It turns out that anything we initially think is an in-itself ends up being so only for-another.) Once we've gone through the whole exercise of putting ourselves in the place of that thing and gaining a deep understanding, it's a "for-itself." Consciousness is always by definition for-itself (we're aware of ourselves), but you wouldn't think, for instance, that a tree is for-itself unless you enter into some reciprocal relation with the tree, considering the conscious experience that produces the tree for you, how it's actually you that's positing that that tree is objectively out there (so it becomes for-another), and then if you &lt;em &gt;really &lt;/em &gt;gain a deep understanding of the tree, well, maybe the tree insofar as it is still a tree doesn't become a for-itself, but there's some unity connecting you and the tree that becomes in-and-for-itself, and that's the end goal of philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are we supposed to really understand that at this point? I don't think so, and maybe the whole project doesn't even work out. In at least one case, we can clearly see how this makes sense (and I'm pulling this from our ep. 36): As babies, we're not self-conscious. We're an in-itself. Then other people give us their attention, so we're a for-another. Finally, we internalize the gaze of these other people and develop self-consciousness, becoming a for-itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hegel didn't consider us and the world and the way we think about the world to be fundamentally different things (again, coming out of this tradition of German Idealism), so we can analogically think of all increases in knowledge as being something like this. What "experience" is for Hegel's theory (and remember that phenomenology = describing experience) is a dialectical movement from a poorer way of looking at the world to a richer one, and this change affects not just the subject (the person having the experience, getting the knowledge) but also the object. So as we're approaching an object we want to know, it's just an in-itself. But in contemplating it, it also becomes for-another, and then when we think about this for-another (i.e. we're thinking in part about our own encounter with it), then that's a new object. The object of experience has changed by being experienced. An object is not a static thing but is a moving process in which we are involved. The logical end-point of this would be us and all the objects being one object, conscious of itself (i.e. God).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the Introduction to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's early opus (1807), featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is the first of three episodes on this very challenging book. It's a book that demands slow, close reading, and in fact we only had time to talk about just the Introduction (X pages) even though we also read the Preface (X pages).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what is this project? It's a series of treatments of various theories in epistemology, and eventually philosophy of science, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion. The "phenomenology" part involves describing our experiences, but Hegel's is an immersive, imaginative phenomenology whereby we try to put ourselves in the shoes of someone accurately described by the theory, and through how the world would seem to us from that perspective, we can then see what's wrong with the theory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In ep. 276, we'll get into the simplest theories of perception, but in this part of the book, he's just explaining why this is a reasonable method. If he were going to just tell you his epistemological views as doctrines or slogans (and you might think that spelling out such views would be a prerequisite of actually doing philosophy), then these would just be abstract. Instead, Hegel thought we need to consider the range of views from the most logically simplistic to the most complex to see how each level of complexity is a reaction to problems in the next-simplest theory. The more complicated theories in this way still contain the traces of their predecessors. The later ones are definitely more adequate, but can't understand them concretely without going through the progression.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This stance means that he's for one against romanticism, which thinks it can leap in one bound to the Absolute (God or whatever the ultimate ground of being is), maybe just by closing one's eyes and feeling very passionately. So &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/06/21/ep272-1-fichte-theology/" target="_blank"&gt;Fichte's &lt;/a &gt;thought that we can experience ourselves as our eternal selves is ruled out. Also, Hegel rules out &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/12/04/ep106-pyrrhonian-skepticism-sextus-empiricus/" target="_blank"&gt;global skepticism &lt;/a &gt;as an incoherent non-starter, so his account is going to differ from those philosophers who are concerned at every point with the doubt that our faculties are adequate to capture experience.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Still, this doesn't mean that Hegel was a "direct realist" a la &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/04/25/ep138-1-john-searle/" target="_blank"&gt;Searle &lt;/a &gt;. In fact, the idea that we just directly perceive objects in an unmediated way is the first position he's going to consider (and which we'll talk through at length in ep. 276) and declare inadequate. The goal of all knowledge-seeking activity is to get at the world as it underlyingly, really is (the Absolute), and we'll find throughout this journey frustration that what seemed to be knowledge has fallen short of this goal. The solution, though, is to bring in more complex considerations, not to just shrug in skepticism. Eventually (by the point of the part of the text that we treated in our long-ago episodes &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/04/02/ep35-hegel-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;35 &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/04/10/ep36-hegel-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;36 &lt;/a &gt;on this book) we find that to make sense of our experience of the world, we &lt;em &gt;have &lt;/em &gt;to bring in social considerations, that no solitary Cartesian project will work where knowledge is just judged based on how clear it looks to me or how confident I am about a causal chain between me and an objective thing in the world. (For a much more quickly delivered synthesis of Descartes' and Hegel's projects, listen to our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/01/20/ep31-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;episode 31 on Husserl's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/01/20/ep31-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Cartesian Meditations &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/01/20/ep31-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;,&lt;/a &gt;which likewise ends with consideration of the "lifeworld," i.e. experience as in part socially constructed.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3rLjr2e" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the A.V.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;After some musings about summer vacation and sunburn, we talk about our preparation for Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;. The plan since (virtually) finalized is that we'll record three episodes on the book: The first will come out next week on the Introduction (we didn't have time to talk about the Preface even though we read it). The second will be on the first two chapters: Sense-certainty and Perception. The third will be just chapter 3: Force and the Understanding.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This turns to some discussion of our current educational goals. Plus, what do we think about Hegel giving copies of his &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology &lt;/em &gt;as a gift? Seth's daughter was disappointed by the zoo.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Start with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/07/17/ep274-1-schelling-self-consciousness-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What sort of self is created in the singular act of self-consciousness that according to Schelling grounds all knowledge? It can't be your personality, or the thing that makes all of your various experiences uniquely yours, because that would require comparison of experiences over time, whereas this is a single, momentary experience (presumably).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We've said that the self in question is actually the act of self-consciousness, so it's a process, not actually a thing, or rather a process that makes itself into a thing. It's the one point in which object and representation, subject and object, the one doing the intuiting and the object being intuited, become one and the same thing. The self is a becoming: becoming an object to oneself. It is its own concept, meaning that the description is the thing we're describing. It is a thought, and it needs to be re-thought constantly in order to exist at all. Moreover, this is not just a thought that occurs to us, but something we can freely think, and this freedom therefore becomes foundational to our existence as human beings.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This freedom, however, is a matter of spontaneity, not conscious choice. We all do this as human beings, and through it, we posit limits to ourselves by putting objects in front of us and thereby become finite and enter into the flow of time. And we know about this primordial act because we're constantly reinforcing it and can imitate it at any time by just stopping to contemplate. Yes, this is pretty weird, but you can fill out the picture by thinking of Schelling as giving another formulation of &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/06/19/ep272-1-fichte-theology-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Fichte's theology &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling’s &lt;em &gt;System of Transcendental Idealism &lt;/em &gt;(1800), Parts 1 and 2. This continues from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-273-friedrich-53324574"&gt;Ep. 273 &lt;/a &gt;and features Mark, Wes, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you're an idealist, and so think that all existence is somehow in our minds, then the key to any knowledge whatsoever would have to be an understanding of the mind. Schelling thought in particular that in the act of recognizing that you are a self, then you get the subjective (the self part) and the objective (the "other" that the self is encountering) all at once. An animal is aware of objects, sure, but its awareness is not "consciousness" in the sense of implicitly involving itself as a subject. So even in (human) perception itself we've got (for Schelling) that joint introduction of subjective and objective, and in the act of turning inward to make explicit that act of self-consciousness that's already contained in regular perception, we can really uncover that fundamental relationship between consciousness and world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;It's the whole task of Schelling's book to pull apart the "moments" within self-consciousness; this ends up being the whole point of philosophy. This isn't quite as weird as it sounds, as even for &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/05/13/episode-2-descartess-meditations-what-can-we-know/" target="_blank"&gt;Descartes &lt;/a &gt;, an analysis of what self-consciousness amounts to is the beginning of philosophy, providing justification for all other knowledge. But this is not just a matter of establishing a foundation for warranted belief, but an inroad for actually gathering knowledge. Part of that introspection that is getting at the self is also getting at the contents of all of our perceptions, everything that everyone tells us, and everything that we do by instinct or custom: That's what it means to say that self-consciousness includes revelation of the objective.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, just saying that what we learn in any arena is going to have something to do with the contents of our consciousness would not be sufficient to justify the claim that the moment of self-consciousness in particular is the linchpin of all knowledge. There has to be something more that looks like the foundationalism of Descartes. But it can't be a matter of establishing through self-consciousness an indubitably true proposition that you can derive the rest of knowledge from, because the experience of self-consciousness is not a proposition, and in fact is required according to Schelling for us to make sense of propositions and truth at all. Rather, self-consciousness for Schelling is the very act of self-consciousness itself; it's an act that creates its own object, and thereby (allegedly) creates objectivity and hence the possibility of truth (i.e. correspondence of object and a thought we have representing that object).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Schelling's text makes an argument similar to the cosmological argument for the existence of God (or even more accurately, Avicenna's). Objects in our experience must depend on (be "conditioned by") something, which in turn must depend on something else until we hit some self-supporting entity (the "unconditioned"). Self-consciousness, as an act that creates its object, can serve as that ultimate ground for knowledge. It provides its own ground. God or atoms cannot for for Schelling's ultimate stopping point, because they're still part of the objective world that his project aims to justify knowledge of.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A central but controversial part of Schelling's picture is that logical truths (which seem like purely elements of thought, i.e. on the subjective side) don't make sense unless we also have an idea of objects (the objective side). You might think that a statement like "A=A" is a truth of pure reason: anything will be identical to itself. But "anything" includes "thing" (or "entity" would also be enough). In some sense, it would still be true that A=A even if the universe never existed at all. But for us to actually understand that claim to be true, we have to have in mind that there really are objects, and so that the universal logical truth applies to objects like that. The logical/subjective is not prior to the empirical/objective; rather, we need them both in order to think.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded June 22, 2021. Wes is on vacation, Dylan is late. Mark and Seth start with some discussion of our former guest Lynda Olman's book called &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3hWkoQv" target="_blank"&gt;Sins against Science: The Scientific Media Hoaxes of Poe, Twain, and Others &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;and her perhaps coming back to talk about feminist philosophy of science or more generally &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_theory" target="_blank"&gt;standpoint epistemology &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Just as an update on the critical race theory discussion we have here: Mark and Seth have been talking to Lawrence Ware about schedule a discussion of Derrick Bell's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3hWomsC" target="_blank"&gt;Faces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;for Pretty Much Pop, which means we don't need to wait until we're all done with Hegel. That book definitely does not require prior treatment of the philosophy of law, but we welcome your recommendations in that area regardless. (Here's that &lt;a href="https://iep.utm.edu/law-phil/" target="_blank"&gt;IEP article &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;After Schelling we'll be having a discussion of the Introduction and Preface of Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;, and that's as far as we've planned to date. We've yet to even firm up the plan to re-release our old episodes on that book to the wider public. I think we're going to re-read some of that stuff (the early, post-intro chapters) and record either a new introduction or a new discussion them. Wes is urging us to jump right to chapter on Hegel's political philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dylan has been reading Martha Nussbaum's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3k3CVNt" target="_blank"&gt;Therapy of Desire &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which is great. We talk about self-care given the pandemic. Should we read &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/galen/" target="_blank"&gt;Galen &lt;/a &gt;? Why doesn't Seth have more content to our Austin alma mater? ...Because professors don't tend to even know what podcasts are. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhiloofAlexandria" target="_blank"&gt;Watch videos by Daniel Bonevac, the very logic/analytic-oriented former head of the department of philosophy at Austin &lt;/a &gt;. PEL has never covered &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8hYVCzR45KU" target="_blank"&gt;the logical positivism of A.J. Ayer &lt;/a &gt;! Alas!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/53324574"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on the introduction of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling’s &lt;em &gt;System of Transcendental Idealism &lt;/em &gt;(1800).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;After a detour into &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/" target="_blank"&gt;psychologism &lt;/a &gt;, we're back to mind vs. world: The only thing that explains the apparent harmony between the world and our knowledge of it (and also our will and what we're able to enact in the world via it) is if they somehow come from the same source, which ends up being the self.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What does it mean to impute intelligence to nature? For Schelling, giving a natural account in terms of mechanism and in terms of teleological directedness is one and the same: Saying that nature obeys natural laws is saying both of these things, and Schelling describes the fact that we can use natural laws, which are mental abstractions, to capture nature means that nature "tends towards spiritualization," like nature itself has within it the directedness toward becoming mental. While simple elements of nature obey simple laws (gravity, magnetism, etc.), more complex creations have more detailed plans (like DNA) buried within them to determine their lawlike development, all the way up to humanity which retains animal directedness but by using reason achieves (lawlike) freedom, i.e. the freedom to achieve our own good.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss a little more about construction of knowledge as an aesthetic act, and start to get into how self-consciousness works. Maybe Schelling was a Sartrean existentialist, in that we all have the freedom to build our world in creative ways.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Given that we decided mid-recording that we'd need to use ep. 274 to finish this up, we rather ran out of steam, so this one's a bit short. Use the extra time to read the book on your own!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling’s &lt;em &gt;System of Transcendental Idealism &lt;/em &gt;(1800), introduction, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the relationship between mind and world? Schelling, as a young acolyte of Fichte, thought that our minds produce the world, but also that the perceiver-world dichotomy comes to us as a single piece, and that "transcendental philosophy" is best described as an exploration of the internal logic of that revelation, which is the experience of self-consciousness itself. The moments of this experience can be separated out and analyzed and actually parallel (and are the ultimate driving force behind) the history of a progressive philosophy and the growth of self-consciousness through history itself. If this idea sounds familiar (and bonkers), it's because Hegel used it as the basis of his much more famous &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This book by Schelling is just as ambitious (and nearly as lengthy) as Hegel's book, and so we're barely scratching the surface of it. We read the introduction and parts one and two, but the difficulty of the text and concepts mean that in this discussion we were only able to give an overview and then go through the introduction in detail. Ep. 274 will go through more of the text.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The most counter-intuitive part of idealism becomes clear when we consider pre-human history. If the mind builds the world, that seems to mean that before there were minds, there was nothing at all, so does that mean that geologists, paleontologists, etc. wrong? No, by no means. A primary, undeniable datum that the idealist needs to handle is the objectivity of the world, and our reading attempts to provide an account of how the subject (the self) relates to the world which will do justice to this. This is in some ways merely a new presentation of the Fichte's ideas, but Schelling's twist on this is to say that a fully formed philosophy can start either with the subject (as in transcendental philosophy) or with the object (as in natural science), and he thinks that if you investigate each of these thoroughly enough you'll end up having to develop the other the other discipline. In investigating the objective world, you'll find that each sensible thing is dependent on something else, i.e. the thing that caused or conditioned it, and given the limits on our possible knowledge this chain can't end (as a theologian philosopher would say) at a necessary God or any other Being like that, but instead would lead back to the Subject as Knower providing the foundation for all this. Schelling's reasons for this take a little explaining (which we do in ep. 274), and are (to my mind) pretty unconvincing. For the most part in this work, Schelling assumed the truth of idealism and tried to a la Kant to give an account of how knowledge of the objective world is possible given this truth. He thought that his idealist picture better addresses traditional philosophical problems about knowledge: If you start off by assuming that mind and world are a really a single thing, then you're not faced with the unbridgeable gap between mind and world that Descartes, Locke, and others had to deal with.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Schelling's focus is the search for a foundational "principle" that is both subject and object at the same time: Again, this is self-consciousness, for convoluted reasons that occupy nearly the whole of our ep. 274 discussion. While animals (those too dumb to have a sense of self, anyway) may interact successfully with the world, only with self-consciousness is true knowledge actually possible, according to Schelling, and this self-consciousness is not just a matter of registering some experience we've had but of a free action that we take that in effect creates the self: Animals just don't have selves at all in this robust sense; they're just part of the fully determined mechanisms of nature even though, sure, they do have consciousness and feelings and all that.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;By beholding this one part of our experience where subject and object are one (because it's an intuition where the subject doing the intuiting is also the the object being intuited), we're supposed to then see how subject and object in the rest of our experience are related, how they presuppose each other so that it really doesn't then make sense to talk about an objective world with no mind in it at all, and yet it also doesn't make sense to talk about a mind that's not situated in a world that is larger in time and space than any of us will or can directly sense. Schelling eventually reveals that the self proper is outside time altogether; this very much parallels the kind of thinking about a creator God that answers the problem of "what was before God or his creation?" by saying that the term "before" doesn't apply to God at all. Why can geology tell us about ages before minds? Well, because minds exist outside of time, and it's the experience of self-consciousness that establishes time itself for us along with the rest of the world, i.e. objectivity. Since subject and object are really created in one act, it's not that there's a mind-substance that exists outside of time prior to this act, because a) mind is not a substance (i.e. an object) at all, and b) there is no "prior" to an act that creates time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A good connection to help understand this that Schelling mentions is Spinoza, who likewise thought that mind and matter are ultimately one, but for Spinoza they're one &lt;em &gt;thing &lt;/em &gt;, i.e. a type of substance that is prior to and underlies both aspects, where for Schelling the conflict is instead between subjectivity and objectivity, where the self, which just &lt;em &gt;is &lt;/em &gt;the act of self-consciousness (so that this act actually &lt;em &gt;creates &lt;/em &gt;the self; it doesn't find a self that was already there), is the foundation for both of these things, and so actually transcends them both. Yet at the same time, this has to be actually something in our experience, meaning that all this weird talk of creating time is something that we can become (sort of) conscious of doing. If you put yourself in the mindset of something like Avicenna's flying man experiment (think total sensory deprivation, which of course we can't achieve because of that pesky heartbeat and breath and proprioception and other things), then your sense of self feels absolutely unlimited, outside of time, space, and the world, because it's only when we confront objects in the sensory world that a limit is put on the self, that it becomes a self by its distinction from these objects.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We can read Fichte's theology into this picture to help make more vivid what in Schelling's book is abstract; Schelling does not directly say (at least in what we read) that, e.g. we have a divine nature that through the primordial act of self-consciousness becomes a concrete thing in the world, or that history is God's gradual coming to self-consciousness of Himself. Though Schelling obviously shared Fichte's primal concern about freedom and many detailed points about the idealist strategy, Fichte was firm about subjectivity being the necessary foundation for philosophy, and Schelling's idea that you could just as well start the inquiry by doing natural science and work back to the subject constituted a break with Fichte that actually dissolved their friendship!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;An interesting consequence of Schelling's view of the relation between mind and nature is that nature ends up being proto-intelligent, in that it obeys natural laws and often displays internal purposefulness (teleology); this is the "vitalism" trend in natural science that was somewhat popular in the age of Romanticism (which this text is leading into) and in accord with the later process philosophy of Whitehead and others (the self is a process for Schelling, after all). Consequently, since nature is so much like the human mind, then figuring out nature is like figuring out a work of art (as a human construction). Being a philosopher ends up requiring artistic discrimination, and the lack of this artistic sense explains (according to Schelling) why so many philosophers can't understand and accept idealism. Those "dogmatists" who insist on the existence of physical objects apart from minds are just a bunch of blockheads!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3qt6kli" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Concluding our coverage of &lt;em &gt;The Vocation of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1799), Books II and III. This discussion continues &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/06/19/ep272-1-fichte-theology-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start out with a bit more wondering about how we build objects with our mind, in particular about whether this entirely uniform because we all have the same psychology as humans, or whether it might seriously vary according to your cultural group or individual idiosyncrasies.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We pretty quickly get to Book III, though, which is primarily ethics and only by extension theology. According to Fichte, the primary datum we as humans receive that might induce us to believe that we're free and that everything matters is our conscience, which is apparently always clear and correct, at least in the general moral principles it urges us to follow, which are of course Kant's: treat everyone as an end in themselves, and not merely as a means to your own ends. But Fichte admits that there's a lot of vice in the world, and those listening to their consciences often disagree about which moral imperatives are most important, and ego and pride enter in such that we all want everyone else to follow our lead on the good efforts that we're most invested in. But part of faith is believing that these disagreements will iron themselves out eventually, that we (as a species and as individuals) learn from our mistakes, and so there will eventually be a single world culture united in mutual respect and good will.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does this view make Fichte an imperialist? Yes, it does, though with the caveats that the world culture should and will bring in the best practices from every culture it subsumes, and also that this individual-respecting culture will not be hyper-conformist in the nightmarish ways you're probably picturing. We don't get in this work specific political solutions such as a prediction that the final culture will be in any way democratic, but that's a reasonable position to read into Fichte. The important (and puzzling) thing is that this utopian society will be structured so that dishonesty and other vice will no longer pay. So this to me implies that there's no money or other private property, because so long as society respects such things, there's always the possibility and temptation to steal or otherwise immorally acquire them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I'm calling this whole episode "theology" because that ends up being the end point and ontological basis of Fichte's morality, metaphysics, and epistemology. There is still objectivity in Fichte's idealism not just because we as individuals externalize objects in a consistent way, but that the mind which does the building of objects is not primarily an individual one, but is a point of view within the mass consciousness that we may as well call God. This divine nature that connects us all is exactly what we hear when the voice of conscience speaks.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;What are we reading for the next episode?&lt;/strong &gt;More German idealism! Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling’s &lt;em &gt;System of Transcendental Idealism &lt;/em &gt;(1800): the introduction plus parts 1 and 2 and a little bit of 3. It'll take us two full discussions (ep. 273 and 274) to get through that much.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/06/05/ep271-1-fichte-transcendental-idealism-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 271 &lt;/a &gt;to cover the rest (Books II and III) of &lt;em &gt;The Vocation of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1799), featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What does idealism, the idea that what we take to be the external world is really just a part of the mind, entail that we do? It seems like we should just be solipsists and hence nihilists: Everything is just in my mind, and so none of the rest of you are real, and just like an a single-player video game (that I apparently wrote myself without being aware of it), I should be able to do whatever I feel like. Fichte was deeply disturbed by this conclusion, and admitted that there's no knowledge available to us that would with certainty ground the need for ethical behavior (or religious beliefs), but used Kant's trick of drawing instead on practical reasons, which refers to the attitude we need to take to actually live and do things.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Basically, we need faith: Either nothing matters, or things really do matter, and to some extent, it's up to each of us to decide this. Yes, there seem to be motivations like pain and pleasure built right in to our experience (and so Locke, for instance, relied entirely on this to found morality), but Fichte instead focused on our experience of conscience and our own freedom to follow it. Insofar as we've been grown well into rational human beings, we all, Fichte claimed, hear the call of conscience, and so feel real freedom regarding it. Conscious tells us that other people have the same dignity we feel that we have. The conscience isn't just giving us information; listening to it means adopting a stance which enables us to have meaningful, rational human lives. This stance projects goodness on to the world through our own efforts and plans, and it involves the expectation that the world can and does progress toward the better, and insofar as there are limits to this progression, we expect that good behavior will always be rewarded in an afterlife if not actually here. To live this way is to live in (or toward) harmony with others, which is to say according to a Divine plan. This underlying harmony that we all participate in to the extent that we take up the ethical stance just &lt;em &gt;is &lt;/em &gt;God. God, like the afterlife, becomes a necessity of practical reason, and the idea that what I take to be myself is just a finite slice of the Eternal Mind that is God then provides the conceptual space for there to be other finite perceivers in the world, because they're really in some (very non-obvious) sense parts of me as well, or rather we are all part of God, and through this leap of faith we rise up from being mere animals to our rightful place as part of God.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Needless to say, despite Fichte's devotion, he was condemned as a heretic and atheist. Ya can't win 'em all!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We spend the first third of this part giving this kind of overview and then proceed to dig deep into the text, spending most of our time still on Book II which lays out Fichte's epistemology. How much of our "building of the world" is made up of inferences (which can be wrong), as opposed to mere sensations (which seem simple but nonetheless according to Fichte include the implicit sensation that it's ME doing the sensing) and intuitions (which are more complex than sensations, but nonetheless don't involve inferences), e.g. the intuition of spatiality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Since we spend so much time towards the end of this part on a particular three-point list in Book II, page 77 in the old translation, I'll just give it to you here in full:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;blockquote &gt;&lt;p &gt;I believe that I have now attained the fullest insight into the origin of my conceptions of objects out of myself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. I am absolutely, because I am conscious of this &lt;em &gt;I &lt;/em &gt;,—myself; and that partly as a practical being, partly as an intelligence. The first consciousness is Sensation, the second Intuition—unlimited space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. I cannot comprehend the unlimited, for I am finite. I therefore set apart, in thought, a certain portion of universal space, and place the former in a certain relation to the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The measure of this limited portion of space is the extent of my own sensibility, according to a principle which may be thus expressed:—Whatever affects me in such or such a manner is to be placed, in space, in such or such relations to the other things which affect me.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/blockquote &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yes, this is happening, and you're getting this second installment in the new series in lieu of a Nightcap this week, as we couldn't get it together to record one between our two Fichte recordings, though we've already got one for you ready for the run-up to Schelling.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Four episodes of PvI have now been recorded, and &lt;a href="http://philosophyimprov.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the website &lt;/a &gt;should be up within the next week. This discussion is a bit heavier on the philosophy than &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/05/19/sneak-preview-pvi1/" target="_blank"&gt;#1 &lt;/a &gt;, with some satire of one of the many positions (Plantinga's? I'd have to re-listen to that discussion) discussed in &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/12/13/ep129-faith-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;PEL #129 on faith &lt;/a &gt;. I'm finding that this format, which involves my having to explain (or better yet, do some Socratic engagement) some philosophical point, really necessitates that I "get real" in relating the philosophy to what is plausible in our actual lives, and since learning improv is all about developing practical habits of being, the philosophical part of the conversation inevitably gets turned away from idle speculation to an applied, "self-help" approach, despite my terrible aversion to that enterprise. (Stoicism gets a little heat here, &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/tag/stoicism/" target="_blank"&gt;for reasons that long-time PEL listeners will be familiar with &lt;/a &gt;; these concerns definitely deserve further consideration in this new format.) My criticism of a philosophical position in this format may well be transformed immediately into some kind of riff on how absurd it would be to actually take that position seriously at face value. What would it really be like to wholeheartedly believe that causation is purely in the mind and not in the world, or that death is not bad because there's no one present any more for it to be bad for?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I'm trying my best to pick topics where I think philosophical thought advances us over everyday intuitions and assumptions, but even so, there's a lot of nearby absurdity to play with. In this case, the topic is "reality," and in addition to illustrating the idea that each of us has assumptions that determine what we take to be the content of our everyday reality (e.g. money, an obvious social creation, can become an obsession, so that we view everything through the lens of its potential monetary value), I have a serious beef with the idea that there is a reality-in-itself that we can never come in contact with any part of. I think I agree with post-Kantians that say that such a reality is indescribable, because the very idea of a "thing" or "event" involves a carving up of reality according to human concerns. So reality itself is inchoate, and our interactions with it pick out/manifest certain aspects. Now, it may really just be a linguistic choice whether one describes this process as us getting at &lt;em &gt;part &lt;/em &gt;of reality (which is my preferred formulation), or that there is a reality itself that is the transcendent inchoate in toto and that the various ways that we might interact with it constitute the phenomenal world (the Kantian formulation). I tend to think that given the variety of ways we can engage with the world, e.g. through the research of quantum physics, it's better not to talk about a single phenomenal world, the world of our common experience, which then gets contrasted with the noumenal world, but just to point at these various ways of engaging without conjecturing that any given way adds up to "a world." Perhaps this is my sympathy with pragmatists like Nelson Goodman, whose &lt;em &gt;Ways of Worldmaking &lt;/em &gt;points to a multiplicity of possible engagements: If not only hard-wired psychology but also cultural and even idiosyncratic individual factors make up the "worlds" we live in, this means that "world" has become a metaphor for something more transitory and incomplete, that we can code-switch or otherwise take up a different frame of mind (whether intentionally or not) and so effectively engage with a different part of reality. Whether this metaphor of a "part" is better than that of a "version" or "lens" or something else depends on whether the parts are in conflict. The parts of a material object like a cup are numerous and in a certain sense incommensurate, in that I can't simultaneously apprehend it on an atomic level and on the macro, sensible level, but because we can explain the difference in approaches that lead these levels, we don't consider them to be truly in conflict. It's not, as early atomists might have believed, that macro perceivers are being fooled, that the atomic level is the "true reality," but that these are both "parts" of what the cup is, and if some of my available conceptual schemes don't even pick out the cup qua cup, e.g. they might pick out a cup time-slice or consider all atoms in a certain space (which include the cup but other things as well), then my language using this different scheme will be different, yes, but ultimately translatable in just the way I've done here. (See &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/05/28/ep191-conceptual-schemes-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Donald Davidson about conceptual schemes &lt;/a &gt;for more of this argument.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I say all this because yes, I'm having fun with philosophy with these discussions, and you're likely not going to get the serious critique of positions as would be possible with my PEL co-hosts pushing back at my interpretations, but Bill is a sharp guy, and having him (and we're considering guests on future episodes) as a "reality check" against the abstractions of philosophy and my ways of formulating them is useful in itself, and I'm hoping that these can serve of both a reminder and application of some of the issues that have come up in PEL discussions, which I'll always cross-reference in the blog posts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks for listening! Take this as you will! I'd love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;-Mark Linsenmayer &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/52190627"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;The Vocation of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1799), Book II.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is Fichte trying to keep the notion of a "real world" beyond our experience or not? It's part of the progression of the text that while at first he assumes that there must be something real behind this experienced world we as individuals create, he gives up that notion in the middle of Book II. So how does he get to his startling reversal?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;First he develops the notion of "intuition" as distinct from perception to explain how we perceive space. Really, we just have these point-to-point experiences of color, but we somehow unconsciously synthesize these into perception of a whole covered surface. This capacity for synthesis is a precondition for having perceptions at all, and so that aspect of perception where such syntheses occur is called intuition, because it's neither mere sensation nor is it full-blown inferential thought, which is the kind of thing that comes into play in more complex parts of perception where we're creatively comparing various intuitions (I say "creatively" because as we discuss, Fichte says that we "annex" or "attach" something extra to our intuitions, some thought that we presumably have to make up, though Fichte doesn't quite say how). We engage in thought, for instance, when we're figuring out how far away some object is based on how clearly we can make it out, how big it looks, and how big things of that sort have looked in our past experiences. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;With that level of complexity, we might be fooled by an optical illusion, as if someone shows us a picture of a building on a TV screen: We're used to buildings being big, and so it looks far away (and was truly far away from the camera), but the image is actually only a few feet from our eyes, and if we though the screen was a window, we'd be fooled. Intuitions (like the perceptions they synthesize) are always accurate, but thoughts need not be. This picture of perception allows us to both be the sole author of everything in our experience and yet still be wrong about things. That would be impossible if experience were like a dream we could change according to the whims of our unconscious minds, but the world for a transcendental idealist is still stable, with facts in it to be discovered and confirmed, if only we think our various intuitions together in a coherent way. (Whether this commits Fichte to a coherence theory of truth is not clear, though. There still might be, within the enlarged world of thought, some facts that beliefs might have to correspond to, and because Fichte believes that within this thought world there's a legitimate distinction between the subjective and the objective, we might not need to just describe truth as a matter of the coherence of all of a person's beliefs.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Some of this distinction between thought and intuition will be made clearer in ep. 272 (where we in fact spend more time still on Book II than on Book III). In the latter portion of this discussion, we get into more quotes about how objects and the I (the subject) arise in experience. It is a fundamental feature of our experience that these always appear as separate, that there are objective objects appearing before me, but these objective and subjective poles must arise out of a fundamental unity, which sounds very much like Heidegger's Being-in-the-World, the point of which is to say that we &lt;em &gt;don't &lt;/em &gt;experience ourselves a la Descartes as passive observers of the world who can legitimately doubt whether there is a world at all, but that world and consciousness (maybe not "self" which might be something synthesized out of different conscious experiences) are always given at the same time. While an anti-skeptic will use this insight to say that doubt about the existence of the external world is fundamentally incoherent, Fichte dismissed that kind of insistence that the natural world is primary and that we are of course animals within it as dogmatism. Instead, the fundamental unity of I and perceived object shows that both are parts of conscious experience, i.e. parts of me, even as some of these parts of myself appear to be as objective (apparently not me) and subjective (obviously me).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This has evidently become a pretty weird sort of phenomenology, if it's even still phenomenology at all: We only ever experience the subject and object as separated, because that separation is what makes experience possible at all, and yet we somehow also experience their fundamental unity. To focus on the subjective side, it sounds initially like Fichte thinks that, as illustrated by Avicenna's flying man thought experiment, our knowledge of self is unmediated, not requiring any objectification. But maybe unlike Avicenna, it's that Heideggerian subject-object unity that we have unmediated knowledge of. But if any fully described perception already has that unity ripped apart into subjective and objective, then that sounds like even our knowledge of self is synthesized out of different perceptions (which is Kant's position). Does our actual experience decide between these interpretations, or is this all Kantian transcendental speculation that goes beyond phenomenology?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Vocation of Man &lt;/em &gt;(1799), Books I and II, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is reality? Fichte is known as a key interpreter of Immanuel Kant who removed the idea of the "thing-in-itself," i.e. reality apart from how we interpret it, from Kant's system. Kant had described how human faculties impose structural features like space, time, number, and causality on the world of our experience, i.e. the phenomenal world, but still retained as essential to ethics and religion the idea that there is a true world behind the phenomenal that we can't know, but we can act in accordance with.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Fichte thought this latter idea wasn't necessary, and the part of this popularization of his system (the more difficult work being his &lt;em &gt;Wissenschaftslehre, &lt;/em &gt;a.k.a. &lt;em &gt;The Science of Knowledge &lt;/em &gt;) that we read for this discussion ends in pure idealism, which means that when you know anything, you're really just being aware of a part of yourself. The work is a series of introspections, like Descartes' &lt;em &gt;Meditations &lt;/em &gt;, but doesn't ask "what can I know?" so much as "what is my vocation?" i.e. "what am I supposed to do?" ...which in turn requires that he interrogate what he can know. Book I, "Doubt," presents an observation of nature that points toward us as integral parts of it, with all of our actions determined in the same giant causal web that determines everything else. He finds this very distressing, so Book II, "Knowledge" reverses course and establishes (through a dialogue with an imagined "Spirit," much like in Boethius) idealism, where human freedom is recovered (if the whole causal web is my own production as ideas, then it wouldn't make sense for that web to itself determine my actions), but at the cost of everything just being empty and meaningless: just my mind playing around. We'll be covering book III in episode 272 where faith allows him to recover this meaning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A little epistemological history: You might think like Locke that all we're really acquainted with is our own ideas, but that those ideas were caused by something out in the world. Hume introduced into this the idea that causality is really not something out in the world at all, but a pattern of expectation imposed by our minds. Still, for both of these figures, the ideas we're immediately aware presumably at least somehow represent or resemble objective things out in the world. Kant made Hume more radical by saying that it's not just causality we impose onto our imagery, but that everything that makes up a "thing" is something that our knowledge faculties introduce. What's ultimately interacting with us to produce all those ideas of things? We have no way of knowing (though we can have faith).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This notion of Kant's was labeled "transcendental idealism" because a) the world we're aware of is made up of our own ideas, and b) what makes those ideas take the shape that they do has something to do with structural features of the mind that we can't actually observe but which we can know about by reasoning about what we do observe: Those features of mind transcend what we actually experience, so any reasoning about them is called transcendental. But Kant wasn't really an idealist in the manner of Berkeley, because while for Berkeley the entire metaphysics was just made up of minds and ideas, Kant also had in his system the noumenal realm (the thing-in-itself) behind the phenomena.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Fichte's system is more like Berkeley's: We literally know only our ideas, and everything we reason about those ideas, such as that they're caused by noumena, is also made up of ideas, and though, sure, some ideas purport to refer to or represent other ideas, we never escape the realm of ideas in any sense. Causality is a pattern in our minds. A mind itself is just a complicated idea. The "I" who has the ideas is also an idea. So we can still do science, but what we're exploring is the relationship between various types of ideas. The subjective-objective distinction does not indicate a divide between mind and world but between two spheres of mind. Clearly, having an idea of "mind" like this means you're not just focusing on what people are perceiving, remembering, or imagining right now, but claiming that there's this idea-structure that exists even when no one is at that moment thinking of it. For Berkeley, this idea-structure was explicitly God's mind, and as we'll see next episode, that's essentially Fichte's strategy as well, though he has a more Kantian, i.e. practical, argument for God's existence than Berkeley's.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;With this overview in mind, what insights does Fichte gain from his neo-Cartesian armchair reflections? While he first in thinking about the interlocking system of nature, a second pass (still in Book I) convinces him that actually, experience doesn't tell us either way whether we're part of the big causal machine of the world or not. This was the Kantian position, and Kant's "practical" philosophy posited that our nature as acting beings takes advantage of this ambiguity in our metaphysical position by assuming that we simply &lt;em &gt;must &lt;/em &gt;be free. Whereas in the phenomenal world of our experience (and of science, which is a systematized extension of experience), everything always happens for causal reasons, Kant identified the ego itself as transcendental: as one of those pieces of our explanatory apparatus that has to exist for experience to make sense, but which we don't ever actually observe. There has to be something, thought Kant, that makes all of my various experiences specifically mine. Instead of (like Sartre, who specifically critiqued this) just saying this is a structural feature within experience, Kant insisted that the transcendental ego lies behind experience, into that otherwise unknown realm of the noumena. Since causality is only something we can reliably attribute to the phenomena, there's no requirement that the transcendental ego must itself have any cause, and so, due to that practical reasoning (again, that we simply &lt;em &gt;can't hel &lt;/em &gt;p but think that we are really free and responsible for our actions, not simply caused by our biology), we get to conclude that freedom exists in the noumenal realm even though it can't exist in the phenomenal realm.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Fichte's theology (again, anticipating next episode, which has already been recorded as I write this) will take a similar position in that he thought that we live simultaneously as causally affected bodies in this world and as perfectly free spirits in an eternal realm, but that eternal realm is more like Plato's heaven than it is "the truth" of the world that we're living in right now, divorced from the filters of our perceptual apparatus (i.e. one of the ways that Kant's view is characterized). Fichte's position is instead more like Plato's and Spinoza's: We participate in the eternal insofar as we use our reason. But reason is not just a matter of contemplation on the model of pondering eternal truths of mathematics, but in paying attention to those aspects of our psychology specific to our status as rational animals, which Fichte identifies as moral characteristics. Whereas Nietzsche mourned detachment from our animal instincts, this is exactly what Fichte encouraged: Turn away from your base instincts and instead heed the dictates of conscience by treating others as ends-in-themselves and seek to find common ground with those others to put all of our wills ultimately in alignment under the guidance of virtue. If you do this, you'll be acting freely, because you as reasoning being will be the legislator of this law (as Kant put it). Since for Fichte, experience in itself doesn't teach us whether we're free or not, faith in your own freedom requires a leap; in this sense Fichte anticipates existentialists like Kierkegaard even as this "leap" is underwritten by practical reason a la Kant. (For another example of using practical reason to jump to a conclusion not established by theoretical reason, consider Pascal's wager.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Fichte's method of self-reflection allows him to conceive of this freedom in terms of that self-reflection: If I were an animal, I would go ahead and just follow any given urge. Because I'm human, I can stop and reflect on that urge and ask whether it's really right, whether I should really follow it. Though the dictates of conscience are always clear (or so Fichte implies in this work; he may well have a more nuanced picture of ethics elsewhere in his corpus), I can always choose to further reflect on that urge of conscience too, to ask whether it's really right or not, and then if I decide that it is, I can again ask whether my decision that it is may have in fact been caused by some subconscious, pernicious influence (my brainwashed upbringing) or is otherwise suspect. This ability to always second-guess ourselves through further acts of self-consciousness, i.e. attempts to deliberate and reason, is at once our strength, in that it's what distinguishes us from animals and constitutes our freedom, and our weakness, in that we can be forever in doubt and unable to actually will anything (Nietzsche's complaint!). On Fichte's account, what stops this reflection and so sets self-imposed limits to reasoning (making a good person merely &lt;em &gt;partially examined &lt;/em &gt;) is faith.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3fUfyn3" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the translation Wes used &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924029040744" target="_blank"&gt;get the archaic one online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

We discuss the foundational text of modern economics, first published in 1776. How does the division of labor and our instinct to exchange lead to the growth of wealth? Is the economy sufficiently machine-like to enable us to manipulate its output, or at least to tell us how not to screw it up?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The selections we read were:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Book I, Ch. I–X with following omissions: the end of Ch. 5 (stop at "Though at distant..."), the end of Ch. X, pt. 1 (stop at "That the chance..."), and part of Ch. X, pt. 2 (stop at "Secondly" and start again at "I shall conclude..."). This covers the division of labor, the origin of money, and factors that contribute to prices, wages, and profit.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Book II, Ch. I and III (stop at "The annual produce of the land and labor of England..."). This covers the accumulation of stock and the difference between productive and unproductive labor.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Book III, Ch. I and IV (stop at "Merchants and manufacturers are the people..."). This covers the symbiotic relationship between town and country in the economy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Book IV, Ch. II (stop at "This order, however, being contrary to the natural…"), Ch. III, pt. 2 (stop at "It is in consequence of these maxims…"), Ch. IX end (start at "The greatest"). This is about why we shouldn't have tariffs or other protections for local trade over foreign trade.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Book V, Ch. I, pt. 3, Article 2, about the economic incentives involved in education.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;For more on Smith's moral views, listen to our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-45-moral-hume-15467492" target="_blank"&gt;ep #45 &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan are joined by PEL fan Jim Marunich, who got his M.A. in this area. As with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-159-confucius-51032578" target="_blank"&gt;our Confucius episode &lt;/a &gt;, we were faced here with a radically different point of view, unconnected with the founding figures of Western philosophy that may systematically prejudice our thinking, formulated in languages that may even involve different underlying ontological assumptions: While we say "the dog is brown," which sounds like it's relating two entities (the object dog and the property brown), they would say "the dog browns," making the having of the property into an action. Unlike in the case of ancient China, we need only look back less than a century to find people practicing a fairly pure form of this tradition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Some preliminaries: Yes, Jim tells us that "American Indian" is more acceptable to native peoples than "Native American," though really there's no agreement. Ideally, we should just be talking about different tribes, as there are multiple languages and traditions here, but scholars have found value in articulating some general themes common to the philosophies of these different groups, so we're attempting to follow suit here.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This was an oral tradition, and philosophical scholarship regarding it is fairly new, with a small body of literature and philosophers working on it. Jim recommended three essays to us from &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0631223045/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0631223045 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=6271df61e838bdc23ce81dabd21f86c1" target="_blank"&gt;American Indian Thought: Philosophical Essays &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2004):&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;"What Coyote and Thales Can Teach Us: An Outline of American Indian Epistemology" by Brian Yazzie Burkhart (a Cherokee) (&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/BurkhartWaters2004.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;"Philosophy of Native Science" by Gregory Cajete (a Tewa) (&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Cajete-2004.-Philosophy-of-Native-Science.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;"Language Matters: A Metaphysic of Non-Discreet, Non-Binary Dualism" by Anne Waters (a Seminole; she edited the anthology; &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/8635161/Language_Matters_A_Metaphysic_of_NonDiscreet_NonBinary_Dualism" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;For primary sources, we read chapter 19 from &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803283911/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0803283911 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=f15bcec103a28b01e7f8d249894be848" target="_blank"&gt;Black Elk Speaks &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(&lt;a href="http://stuff.samassaveneessa.info/docs/BlackElkSpeaks.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here's an online version &lt;/a &gt;, which lacks the many helpful notes in the paper one) by John G. Neihard (1932), an American writer who took down (and embellished) the reports of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Elk" target="_blank"&gt;a Lakota (Sioux) medicine man &lt;/a &gt;. We also read some stories about the trickster Coyote in part 7 of &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394740181/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0394740181 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=8440c8279469e15e42a0c5fe2fa1edc9" target="_blank"&gt;American Indian Myths and Legends &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, plus another fable, "How the Buzzard Got His Feathers" (&lt;a href="http://www.indians.org/welker/buzzard.htm" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we read Jim's thesis: "Process Metaphysics in the Far West: American Indian Ontologies" (&lt;a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/rws_etd/document/get/kent1305650448/inline" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;), which gave us the clearest connections to Western philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another helpful secondary source was &lt;a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-philosophy/oclc/48386437 &amp;amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"&gt;The Great Courses' &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-philosophy/oclc/48386437 &amp;amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"&gt;World Philosophy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-philosophy/oclc/48386437 &amp;amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"&gt;lectures &lt;/a &gt;by Kathleen Higgins: Lecture 6: Traditional Beliefs and Philosophy and Lecture 7: American Indian Thinking.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;That's a lot of material, and our goal was not to go through each source to detail what the various authors had to say. We encourage interested folks to read the articles yourself to get a better flavor of how these ideas are conveyed. Instead, we picked up on some overall themes as conveyed by the articles and tried to make sense of them:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Relationality &lt;/strong &gt;: What does it mean to say that everything is related to everything else? This claim is supposed to communicate our ethical duties to the world we experience, not just people, but nature.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Experience and tradition &lt;/strong &gt;: How do we know what these ethical duties are? Phenomenologically: We experience the world. But we (i.e., those born into this tradition) see the world through a lens of tradition, through the gathered experiences of our forebears.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Concrete practicality over abstract principle &lt;/strong &gt;: According to Burkhart, American Indian thought lacks a paradigm in &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/12/24/ep86-thomas-kuhn/" target="_blank"&gt;Kuhn's &lt;/a &gt;sense. We aren't supposed to come at the world with a preconceived framework for what is and isn't possible; we're instead supposed to be simply open to experience as it comes. But does this actually make sense, and if so, does it leave us defenseless against superstitious nonsense?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Stories and rituals as cultural transmission &lt;/strong &gt;: Instead of principles, we get ritually prescribed actions and narratives that are supposed to remind us of our relationality and pass on specific insights about the natural world, e.g., Burkhart describes how the Seneca tribe discovered that corn, beans, and squash grow well together and conveyed this via a story where these three entities approach humanity and explain that they're sisters, and they'll only enter into relations with people if they're always grown together.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Lack of firm labels and dichotomies &lt;/strong &gt;: Anne Waters argues that a different attitude toward labeling things makes American Indian viewpoints inherently more tolerant to those that don't fit into a strict binary gender framework.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Process over substance ontology &lt;/strong &gt;: Why the lack of emphasis on labels? Because everything is in flux, per our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-79-heraclitus-27507479" target="_blank"&gt;Heraclitus episode &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Intuition and the subconscious &lt;/strong &gt;: Why this emphasis on immediacy against conceptualization? As was emphasized in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/52103495" target="_blank"&gt;our discussion with Dr. Drew &lt;/a &gt;, so much of our orientation, our sense of self, relies on a preverbal, unconscious relationship that we have with others. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-81-jung-on-w-27510128" target="_blank"&gt;Carl Jung (ep 81)&lt;/a &gt;describes intuition as a matter of unconscious synthesis of a wide range of experience. These types of processes are what give us our moral orientation (relationality), provide epistemic guidelines in lieu of a set of explicit epistemic principles, and generalize the way we interact with other people to the way we interact with everything around us. Cajete says, "Every act, element, plant, animal, and natural process is considered to have a moving spirit with which we continually communicate." This sounds crazy, but think about our conversation with Dr. Drew about how we attribute mentality to others: Before the stage where we attribute explicit beliefs and desires to people, we already understand nature as teleological, which Cajete would describe as alive and creative.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: “Circle’s Gotta Go” by Kim Rancourt, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/08/20/nem52-kim-rancourt/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #52 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Black Elk picture by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 10/2/17.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Radio legend and PEL fan &lt;a href="http://drdrew.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Drew &lt;/a &gt;Pinsky introduces us to some psychology papers on the theory of mind and the establishment of the sense of self:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;“Attachment and reflective function: their role in self-organization” by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fonagy" target="_blank"&gt;Peter Fonagy &lt;/a &gt;and Mary Target (1997) (&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Fonagy-Attachment-and-reflective-function-Their-role-in-self-organization.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;“Attachment and the regulation of the right brain” by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Schore" target="_blank"&gt;Allan N. Schore &lt;/a &gt;(2000) (&lt;a href="http://www.allanschore.com/pdf/SchoreAttachHumDev.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;“Right-Brain Affect Regulation" by Allan N. Schore (2009) (&lt;a href="http://www.allanschore.com/pdf/__SchoreFosha09.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/theomind/" target="_blank"&gt;Theory of Mind &lt;/a &gt;" is not what philosophers talk about when dealing with the philosophy of mind, but a term in psychology referring to how we impute intentions, desires, and goals to other people. Fonagy uses the term "reflective function" to describe our ability to "read people's minds," in the sense that we can predict others' behavior based on our ability to think of them as having minds. A schizophrenic, for instance, can't do this, and so everyone else is strange to him. He doesn't know how to behave as other people would want him to because he doesn't know what they want, or really think of them as wanting at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Much of the story here is developmental—like learning language (according to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Linguistic_theory" target="_blank"&gt;the Chomskyan picture &lt;/a &gt;of language acquisition at least). Reflective function is a built-in human ability, with a number of predetermined steps in its development, but individuals can vary in how it develops, and certainly things can go wrong for various reasons. Using a story that goes back to &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html" target="_blank"&gt;John Bowlby &lt;/a &gt;, Fonagy points at attachment with caregivers as a key component in the normal develop of this faculty. If our parents are attentive, then they react to us as babies as if we have minds, and in this way we figure out what having a mind is, and that both others and we ourselves have them. If this doesn't happen, we not only fail to connect with others but don't even have a coherent sense of self.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This idea that we get our own sense of self from interaction with another should be familiar to PEL listeners, and a lot of the purpose of this discussion was to reflect on some of these older philosophical ideas using modern, experimental psychology. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Listen to Dr. Drew's various podcasts at &lt;a href="http://www.drdrew.com/" target="_blank"&gt;DrDrew.com &lt;/a &gt;. He has actually &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gfrTpG5Kq6A" target="_blank"&gt;interviewed Allan Schore &lt;/a &gt;, and then more recently interviewed &lt;a href="http://drdrew.com/2017/wes-alwan-episode-288/" target="_blank"&gt;Wes &lt;/a &gt;and then &lt;a href="http://drdrew.com/2017/mark-linsenmayer-episode-297/" target="_blank"&gt;Mark &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Anything but Love" by Steve Hackett, as featured on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/05/21/nem45-steve-hackett/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #45 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 9/17/17.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

His past books like &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679758941/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0679758941 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=4563d2774b06ef93e0b2b615c9d54f4a" target="_blank"&gt;Nonzero &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;and &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679763996/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0679763996 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=ff2d93999dd51882238d99cab6d4a6cc" target="_blank"&gt;The Moral Animal &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;lay down foundations for talking about the evolutionary reasons why we feel ourselves to have the sense of self, emotions, moral sentiments, and purposes that we do. Now, he applies that insight to explicating the human condition as Western Buddhism (meaning Buddhism without supernatural elements; see also &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/03/26/episode-53-buddhism-and-naturalism-with-guest-owen-flanagan/" target="_blank"&gt;our interview with Owen Flanagan &lt;/a &gt;) describes it: We are fundamentally deluded in a number of ways, and Bob thinks that meditative practice can help us see the world more truly, discarding some of what makes us suffer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For instance, maybe you tend to get jealous, and Bob can give you an evolutionary story why feeling this way would have helped your ancestors, i.e., was "true" (i.e., adaptive) for them. But it's not such a useful emotion for us now, and keeps us from objectively evaluating our situation. Focusing meditatively on negative emotions like this can help you gain distance from them, see them as something happening &lt;em &gt;to &lt;/em &gt;you, not as really part of you. Our feelings and desires are leftover instructions from an evolutionary past, and in many cases they just don't fruitfully apply to today's world. We don't need to go into fight-or-flight mode, certainly not in reaction to social anxiety or other modern worries. While we certainly don't want to ditch love, we don't thrive when controlled by really needy, jealous love.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In fact, the whole unified sense of "self" that you have, and the consequent helplessness you may feel when things are out of your control, are illusions, according to Buddhism. You never were in control in the first place! To get the classical picture here, we read and discuss with Bob the Buddha's so-called Second Discourse, i.e., the very short "&lt;a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.059.nymo.html" target="_blank"&gt;Anatta-lakkhana Sutta: The Discourse on the Not-Self Characteristic &lt;/a &gt;." If your emotions like jealousy really were &lt;em &gt;you &lt;/em &gt;, really part of the thing that sees out through your eyes and makes your decisions, then (argues the Buddha) you'd have control over them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But you don't: emotions just happen, and you shouldn't take them so personally. The same goes for your body, your thoughts, and everything you might consider &lt;em &gt;you &lt;/em &gt;. For Bob's purposes, we don't actually have to follow this argument all the way in the manner of an orthodox Buddhist to the point that we deny that there is any self at all, i.e., no consciousness that you'd want to call "you," but there certainly is no central, unified decision-maker running the show in your mind. That's just another trick of evolution: we need to present ourselves as unified and in control in order to impress mates and to act decisively in do-or-die situations.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Bob points to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_of_mind" target="_blank"&gt;modular model of mind &lt;/a &gt;to support the idea that this unified self is an illusion. On this model, the mind is a collection of processors, and there's a "jealousy module," i.e., a particular functional system within the brain, that is competing for control with other modules, and the module that gets most pumped up with emotion wins the day. By just stopping and looking at the emotion as it starts, you keep that module from taking control. Ironically, you become more self-controlled the more you can see that you are not a unified self.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The other big Buddhism trope besides "no self" that Bob reinterprets for his own purposes is "emptiness" (discussed in its more traditional form in our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/10/10/ep27-nagarjuna-buddhism-citizens/" target="_blank"&gt;episode #27 on Nagarjuna &lt;/a &gt;). Experiencing emptiness is seeing things without a superadded "essence," which Bob characterizes as the emotional affect we add to things. To make this idea clear, he gives the example of JFK's pen. It might be identical to many other pens, but if you think this is the very pen that JFK carried around, it gains a special emotional resonance for you beyond its physical and functional properties. We apply these affective sheaths to just about everything, giving objects that are in fact neutral a special connection to us, so that &lt;em &gt;my &lt;/em &gt;car stands out to me beyond other cars, and Bob says he has a special affection for tape measures. Most importantly, we attribute these essences to people, characterizing them (maybe without realizing it) as friend or foe, as having some certain, established positive or negative charge that then influences how we interpret their actions in the future: If someone we like does something despicable, we tend to excuse it, to focus on the friend's reasons for this uncharacteristic behavior, whereas if someone we dislike does the very same thing, we see it as coming straight from that person's horrid character.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Again, meditation is supposed to reveal to us the workings of our mind, the ways in which we attribute these essences, and allow us to distance ourselves from such attributions, to see things and people more clearly.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But does any of this amount to seeing metaphysical truth? And can we really, through introspection, observe how our minds construct the experienced world, or does meditation really just reinforce for the meditator whatever Buddhist doctrines he's basing his practice on? Aren't there many other practices (like exercising, &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/02/03/episode-50-pirsigs-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance/" target="_blank"&gt;fixing motorcycles &lt;/a &gt;, listening to music, or doing philosophy) that also make us less reactive, less unreasonable and unfair to others, without Buddhist meditation's introspective pretense?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;And what's the epistemic status of explanations in evolutionary psychology anyway? Do we have to posit that an emotion like jealousy or self-loathing was at some point adaptive, or isn't it more likely that many aspects of our psychology more or less evolved as a package deal, so that, e.g., we needed big brains for communication and then got all this other crap with it that was not itself selected for?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Interested? &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439195455/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1439195455 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=e408a9b8fb3c77e8ffa4e752e9e7472e" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the 1967 neo-Marxist, Situtationist book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is culture? In modern capitalism, Debord thinks that it's all about the economy. It's not just our jobs that keep us trapped, but our life outside of working hours is also demanded by "the system" via our activity as consumers, and this commoditization infiltrates every corner of our lives.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Debord wants us to WAKE UP, break our chains, and live lives of immediacy, vitality, and authenticity. This means wrenching ourselves from "the spectacle," which is not just the media created to distract us, but our whole shallow culture where technology, efficiency, and loss of aesthetic quality in favor of economic quantity all isolate us from each other so that we can't effectively engage in political opposition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is this all a bit exaggerated? Is the type of shallowness Debord refers to really restricted to the modern age, or to capitalism? Haven't we always had spectacles foisted upon us to keep us in line? Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan delve into this prescient critique and come up firing on all four cylinders.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0946061122/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0946061122 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=f629dd4c70520810e7a7c250af515aa3" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/guy-debord-the-society-of-the-spectacle.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can read Debord's 1988 follow-up, &lt;em &gt;Comments on the Society of the Spectacle &lt;/em &gt;, &lt;a href="https://libcom.org/files/Comments%20on%20the%20Society%20of%20the%20Spectacle.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;&lt;em &gt;Jimmy Stewart gazes into the abyss of unmeaning &lt;/em &gt;&lt;/strong &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the film &lt;em &gt;Vertigo &lt;/em &gt;by Alfred Hitchcock (1958) and articles analyzing it including Laura Mulvey's "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975) and Robin Wood's "Vertigo" (1965).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(film)" target="_blank"&gt;Vertigo &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;has received more scholarly analysis than perhaps any film in history, and the PEL foursome talk through its free-play with cinematic conventions, its themes, and the philosophical issues involved. It's a thriller/detective story about a man crippled by trauma associated with his fear of heights who falls in love with a mysterious woman he has been tasked with following, and their increasingly crazy relationship.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One key theme is the nature of love and lust: Is the messed up interplay depicted of this film simply an aberration, or does it show us some dark undercurrent essential to romance? According to Jacques Lacan, "there is no sexual relationship," meaning that sex doesn't really touch the "otherness" of the other person; we remain isolated, getting pleasure from flesh and from an image we have in mind. (This strange view is explained in more detail in &lt;a href="https://leonbrenner.com/2016/11/08/there-is-no-sexual-relationship/" target="_blank"&gt;this blog post &lt;/a &gt;by Leon Brenner.) Laura Mulvey describes the woman as made into an object, first by the protagonist's stalkery gaze, and later explicitly through a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(play)" target="_blank"&gt;Pygmalion-type &lt;/a &gt;reshaping to meet an ideal of beauty. And of course, we as spectators of the movie are objectifying her as well, though Hitchcock plays with this by shifting the narrative persona to her at a key point. Is femininity as our culture defines it really an artificial creation of men, designed for their pleasure and not for the benefit of women?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Interpreting the film existentially, is the vertigo depicted here not just the quirk of a particular character, but some part of the human condition, like nausea for Sartre or anxiety for Heidegger? Robin Wood describes the protagonist as perpetually hanging over an abyss for the whole film… metaphorically, but even perhaps literally, given that it starts with him literally hanging from a ledge and never actually explains how he could possibly have been rescued. Are we, too, always one step away from falling off the firm-seeming but ultimately illusory grounding that society is designed to keep us staring at? Perhaps when we leave Plato's cave and depart from the norm, we don't see a changeless heaven, but a void of non-meaning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9YLXU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000I9YLXU &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=9aa9c5eff0817ab48dadcce52eb8bb99" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the film &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oetPo5LCMHM" target="_blank"&gt;watch it online &lt;/a &gt;(note that you can &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WrOKBmsOw7I" target="_blank"&gt;watch it in its proper form on YouTube &lt;/a &gt;for $3).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here are the full citations for all the articles that we were supposed to have read, though only the Mulvey and the Wood came up by name in our discussion:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Laura Mulvey: "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975) from &lt;em &gt;Film Theory and Criticism: Introductory Readings &lt;/em &gt;(Eds.

Less than a century later, Darwin provided an alternative that undermines the common intuition Hume is talking about. Apparent design, Darwin claims, is just the result of random variation (Darwin actually had no idea why this occurred) plus differential survival of variants depending on the survival or reproductive advantage of the variations. If pollution darkens the bark of trees, then the dark moths who blend into those trees get eaten less and propagate more widely than light-colored moths.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though the book is light on philosophical argumentation, Darwin was certainly aware of the implications of his theory, and so he sneaks the reader toward it, starting off in chapter one with examples of the enormous varieties within a species produced by domestic breeding of plants and animals. In chapter two he argues for the claim that such variation happens in the natural world too, and that there's no hard-and-fast line between the concept of a species and that of a variety within a species. Chapter three covers the struggle for existence, which causes any naturally occurring variations that provide a survival advantage to become more prevalent with succeeding generations. Finally in chapter four we get his theory of natural selection. Chapter six responds to objections to the theory, and chapter fourteen summarizes and concludes the book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth go through the book's arguments, put Darwin's theory in historical context with prior theories of evolution like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" target="_blank"&gt;Lamarck's &lt;/a &gt;, and talk about how an evolutionary way of looking at things has influenced philosophers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451529065/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0451529065 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=9f40b204196a6188a27c6f317a4d2b14" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2009/2009-h/2009-h.htm" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

How would a scientifically minded person argue for the existence of God?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In Hume's dialogue, a character named Cleanthes argues from this point of view for God's existence based on the complexity and order apparent in nature: It looks designed. But how good is that argument, and is it enough to prove an &lt;em &gt;infinite &lt;/em &gt;God of the traditional sort?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Stephen West from the &lt;a href="http://philosophizethis.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophize This!&lt;/a &gt;podcast joins Mark, Wes, and Dylan to talk through the roles of the different characters in the dialogue, whether their various arguments make sense, and what Hume's actual views might be. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Cw9EuVuV2qk" target="_blank"&gt;Watch a video accompanying Mark's episode introduction &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872204022/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0872204022 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=e0281b2720f17c4e3317172445ca868b" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or you can try &lt;a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/hume1779.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;(the one Mark used) or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/dialoguesconcern1779hume" target="_blank"&gt;this one &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Here Comes the Flood" by The Security Project, live 2016.

Is theocracy in any way a good idea?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/06/04/ep165-spinoza-bible-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 165 &lt;/a &gt;we outlined Spinoza's project in the book and looked closely at how he thinks the funny bits about miracles and prophets should be interpreted. Here we focus on the political upshot: Spinoza remains convinced that religion is needed for morality and civic-mindedness, but wants to avoid religious wars, persecution, and factionalism. What's essential and inarguable about the Bible (and presumably any other religious text), he thinks, is its command to "love thy neighbor," and this, to Spinoza, is the full essence of religion, and is what should be advocated and reinforced by the state. On all the other points of belief (Was Jesus resurrected? Should we eat pork?), the state should allow people to believe what they want to and say what they want to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does this "essence of religion" really just boil down to acting charitably, which Spinoza sometimes says, meaning it's altogether irrelevant what you believe or claim to believe? To answer this, we have to get at what he means by acting morally. In &lt;em &gt;The Ethics &lt;/em &gt;(our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/09/10/ep25-spinoza-human-nature-citizens/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 25 &lt;/a &gt;), we saw that Spinoza does have a very Aristotelian notion (see &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/09/17/ep147-aristotle-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 147 &lt;/a &gt;) of the relation between reason and virtue: To the extent that we are reasonable, we understand what our true good as humans is, which is to be masters of our passions, contemplative and social, and in harmony with our fellows. However, most people aren't led by reason, and so they need religion to tell them to be moral, and the state to enforce that morality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Contra the Aristotelian influence, part of Spinoza's take on ethics comes straight from &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/06/07/ep3-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Hobbes &lt;/a &gt;: In the state of nature, before any state is formed, there is no "right" or "wrong." Those terms are human creations, and specifically, legalisms: The sovereign (whether that be an actual king or the majority in a democracy) determines what is and isn't right, and so those terms don't even apply to those outside of a society. Our "natural right" is just the same as our actual power to achieve our desires. It's just that because of the weakness of individuals in the face of others' desires, it's in our interest to assent to being in a society. Even if that society is repressive, it's still better than chaos, and so, given Spinoza's determinism, you DO choose society (the "social contract," though Spinoza doesn't call it that).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yes, the above distinction between "good" (reasonable) and "right" (what the sovereign says) is very strange, and we discuss that (the most pressing aspect of that being, again, what if the state is tyrannical and repressive?), but the point in my story here is that to be charitable is not just what it sounds like to us, but for Spinoza is going to involve &lt;em &gt;obeying &lt;/em &gt;. To obey God is for Spinoza both the same as obeying reason itself, but also obeying the state... since it is reasonable to obey the state (it being better than chaos) and since the state has the responsibility for being the arbiter of morality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the "essence of religion" isn't just acting charitably, but acting charitably out of obedience, and that attitude, Spinoza says, will necessarily involve some minimal beliefs in what he takes to be the core propositions of religion. He calls these "the dogmas of universal faith" and they include things like believing that there is a God who is supremely just and merciful, He is singular and omnipresent, with supreme dominion over all things; that belief in Him is required to be saved, and that He forgives the repentant their sins. Now, this is quite a list, and since the state on Spinoza's view has to enforce this, he's advocating for a kind of theocracy, albeit a minimalist, non-denominational one that makes priests subordinate to the state.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;After puzzling through this, the PEL foursome finally discusses Spinoza's famed freedom of speech. Yes, he was ahead of his time and highly influential an allowing for such a thing, but he believed that this freedom has limits. Of course, so do we, but his limits are not the same as ours; he's okay with disagreeing with the government's decisions, and in fact wants open debate to result in better government, but when criticism gets strong enough that it's trying to undermine the government's legitimacy, then that's too far. So it would be OK for us to civilly disagree with Trump and advocate for him to lose the next election, but not to repeatedly point out his lying and incompetence in the attempt to somehow get him out of office &lt;em &gt;soon &lt;/em &gt;before he gets us nuked or something. A lot of late-night comedians would still be jailed under Spinoza's version of free speech.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy the &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CF0K6GG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00CF0K6GG &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=f17383515c8253d98c31508ed6437b81" target="_blank"&gt;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(that's the translation we recommend), or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/tractatustheolog00elweuoft" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The &lt;em &gt;Tractatus Politicus &lt;/em &gt;mostly repeats the same information about the Hobbesian basis for Spinoza's political philosophy as the &lt;em &gt;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus &lt;/em &gt;, except without all the religion talk.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Benedict de Spinoza's &lt;em &gt;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus &lt;/em &gt;(1670), ch. 1–11.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the proper relationship between church and state? That seems like a no-brainer to us now, but that's thanks to a long intellectual tradition that fed directly out of Spinoza, and a Spinoza-like take on, say, Islam is badly needed in many parts of the world today.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Spinoza, despite what his critics said, was not an atheist, and in fact in this book is much more apparently sympathetic toward the traditional picture of God (i.e., He loves you, you must obey him, etc.) than we saw in the &lt;em &gt;Ethics &lt;/em &gt;(see &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/05/29/reissue-ep24-spinoza/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 24 &lt;/a &gt;). Spinoza was sick of various people using their interpretations of the Bible to oppress others, and so his goal here isn't to give "the correct" interpretation of the Bible so much as to provide a way of reading it that will allow for honest differences of opinion on theological matters, and consequently tolerance of differing theological (and philosophical) views.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Spinoza wants to acknowledge first of all that there are obvious internal inconsistencies in the Bible (and he does this with numerous quotes, none of which you'll see in this summary), and inconsistencies between what the Bible explicitly says (e.g., "the sun stood still") and what makes any sense for us to believe. His solution: study the Bible to try to figure out the source material of the various sections. The sections by different authors are going to reflect the prejudices of the authors, of the people being quoted, and of the audiences. The point of the Bible is to get people to &lt;em &gt;act virtuously &lt;/em &gt;, and the literal content of the illustrations or stories or scare tactics that the various prophets may have used to get people in line should not distract from that central message: Be good, or things will go badly.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Chapters 1 and 2 are devoted to prophecy, and while Spinoza is agnostic re. whether prophets could, say, actually depict the future in ways verifiable to their listeners (many of the stories involve "a sign" that provides such proof, e.g., Moses predicting the various plagues that then proved he was the real deal), he is clear that, again, their core message is "repent," and that beyond this moral knowledge, the rest of their message was fueled by their imaginations. They did not display philosophical knowledge of God, but on the contrary used whatever imagery represented the extraordinary and divine to their listeners, and their prophecies often followed their characters, in that a gloomy person would emphasize the doom involved in continued vice while a cheery one would foretell glory if only the hearers would listen.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though he does consider Christianity and discusses Jesus and his Apostles positively (his audience included leftist Christians), he largely focuses his attention on the Old Testament, and in particular on Moses and the prophets after him. He discusses Moses's laws as designed for a particular place, time, and population: Those people, used as they were to being slaves, needed to be told every little thing to do, needed to be obedient. The particular rituals and they were charged with, Spinoza says, were only binding for that particular covenant, and after the Temple fell and the covenant was dissolved, they no longer applied even to the Jews of that time, much less to anyone now. What does still apply, and what was reinforced in the Gospel of Jesus, which was explicitly aimed at &lt;em &gt;everyone &lt;/em &gt;, is just the commandment to love your neighbor, and so this is what obeying God amounts to. So if people want to practice particular rituals, or believe particular parts of the stories over others, that's fine, but should not distract from this central imperative.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So far Spinoza thinks his conclusions are derived purely from a careful study of the text itself: This is a collection of histories recorded with varying degrees of accuracy, aimed at common people, written in languages that no one speaks anymore with idiosyncratic, ancient usages of many of the words, passed down through many hands, assembled by a committee. So it's no wonder that we often can't figure out now what's being said, and there's no sense trying to force consistency and reasonableness on the text. You might think you're being charitable by doing so, but really you're just imposing your own beliefs, and making the text say what you want it to say. This is not respectful.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One point where he does more overtly diverge from trying to merely use the text to critique itself is in considering miracles (chapter 6). Again, he's going to say that we can't really know for certain what went on, whether there's an attempt to relate historical events or not, but we can say what a miracle is, based on what we know about God and the world, and this is where Spinoza's philosophy does come in. Everything is God, and nature's laws are God's will. The regularity of nature is one of the most powerful proofs of God, and so some happenstance that allegedly breaks those regularities would not, actually, be proof of the divine, but would make nature look &lt;em &gt;less &lt;/em &gt;regular, and so actually undermine the belief in God. So if something like this did happen, we can be sure that it did have a natural cause, which is what "caused by God" amounts to; there's just no way that God set up normal laws but then personally intervenes in the causal matrix in some special circumstances.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Likewise, God is not a "law giver" in the sense of issuing particular, arbitrary decrees. If Moses or some other prophet had insight into what a particular population should do, then that amounts to intuiting something about the cause and effect of the universe: If the Israelites kept to these commandments, then they would prosper. Spinoza even gives the example of Adam, the first man, as receiving the command from God not to eat the apple: Adam might have thought that this was just God issuing an ordinance like a king might, but no, God (again, assuming this actually happened, and understanding that God isn't the type of being to literally talk to people, like with a mouth and a voice and all that) was just stating a fact to Adam: If you eat this, bad things will follow.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If this sounds like a weird balancing act between deferring to and denying the claims of religion, it is. All four PEL guys are on this one. Spinoza is Seth's favorite philosopher, and this text has been long requested by Dylan. Wes interprets Spinoza as taking religion less seriously and just giving lip service to the powers that be, while Mark reads him more at his word, and sees the text as insufficiently progressive.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is just the first of two discussions we'll be having about this book, with ep. 166 focused more on Spinoza's political views, including his notions of freedom of speech and its limits.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CF0K6GG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00CF0K6GG &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=f17383515c8253d98c31508ed6437b81" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Israel translation that most of us read &lt;/a &gt;, or try &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/tractatustheolog00elweuoft" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Spinoza picture by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Get a &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/product/baruch-spinoza-t-shirt/" target="_blank"&gt;Spinoza T-Shirt &lt;/a &gt;!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Spinoza's Dream" (2016) by Dave Nachmanoff, as discussed on Nakedly Examined Music &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/07/28/nem20-dave-nachmanoff/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 20 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 6/4/17.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Wes reveals the secret of his news diet. Dylan expresses some general political disgruntlement and we try to figure out what specifically he's talking about. How can we foster healthy political discourse? Should we try to get our bell hooks guest Myisha Cherry back on to talk about her forthcoming book &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myishacherry.org/the-case-for-rage/" target="_blank"&gt;The Case for Rage &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, or should we avoid such things like the plague?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on &lt;em &gt;God and the World’s Arrangement: Readings from Vedanta and Nyaya Philosophy of Religion &lt;/em &gt;after the departure of our guest, Stephen Phillips.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes grills Seth and Mark on what's really new here philosophically: We're all familiar with the design argument, so why wade through all these unfamiliar schools and archaic formulations? So we talk more about these readings in the Indian context of liberation, relating this to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/12/03/ep204-bhagavad-gita-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our previous discussion of the Bhagavad-Gita &lt;/a &gt;and its fundamental distinction between perusha (unchanging mind, just a witness to existence) vs. prakriti (nature, including our bodies and those parts of our minds that change) which seems reflected in the Sāṃkhya position. The latter of these seems to be nearly the same thing as Vācaspati Miśra our our text calls &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradhana" target="_blank"&gt;pradhana &lt;/a &gt;. The difference is that while we're all aware of prakriti (it's everything you experience except yourself), pradhna is a theoretical entity: prarkiti before it's unfolded into all its various visible forms.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We reflect on reason vs. revelation in this milieu and the degree to which we might want to read anything else like this any time soon and under what conditions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the new book &lt;em &gt;God and the World’s Arrangement: Readings from Vedanta and Nyaya Philosophy of Religion &lt;/em &gt;, which presents two takes on the argument that God must exist because the world is a "product." The first is excerpted from the &lt;em &gt;Brahma-sūtra &lt;/em &gt;(a.k.a. the &lt;em &gt;Vedānta-sutra &lt;/em &gt;, compiled ca. the 2nd century C.E.) verses 2.2.1-2.2.10 with commentary from Śaṅkara (710 C.E.) and Vācaspati Miśra (960 C.E.). The second presents an extended argument by Vācaspati on the (maybe as old as the 2nd century B.C.E.) &lt;em &gt;Nyāya-sūtra &lt;/em &gt;. Mark, Seth, and Wes are joined by one of the three translators of the book, &lt;a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/philosophy/faculty/shp9" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Phillips &lt;/a &gt;, who taught until recently at The University of Texas, your hosts' graduate school alma mater. (The others being Nirmalaya Guha and Matthew Dasti.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The argument is very similar to the Western argument from design as put forward by William Paley and criticized by David Hume. The world is a complex and particular arrangement of pieces, like a watch (Paley's example) or a pot or palace (examples from our readings). What makes these arguments different, aside from their much greater age, is the context: The theological, philosophical, and technical apparatus that these figures draw on. To point at a technical feature: The kind of syllogisms (formal logic) employed in Indian philosophy at this time have a particular structure. An Aristotelian (Western) syllogistic version of this argument might say "Everything that is evidently designed must have a designer. The world sure looks evidently designed. Therefore there was a designer: God!" The Indian version uses this form instead:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ol &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;The natural world (bodies, trees, mountains, etc.) has a designer [so you start by stating what you want to prove]&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;...Because it involves a lot of little pieces put together in a certain, careful way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Anything that has a lot of little pieces put together in a careful way has a designer, like a pot does.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;The natural world falls under the generalization in #3.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Therefore it has a designer &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ol &gt;&lt;p &gt;The key difference here is in #3, i.e. the universal claim. Where Aristotle's form just makes this claim as a premise, the Indian form insists that you provide an example to ground it, which gives a couple of clear ways to counter-argue. Maybe the example given is actually bad; it doesn't establish the universal claim, or perhaps even supports its opposite. Or even if the example is good, maybe the thing you're arguing about isn't sufficiently like it to be able to establish #4, i.e. that what you're arguing about is covered by the universal claim.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The two texts from our reading present this argument differ in who's writing the argument, and who they're arguing against, since another stylistic feature of the argumentation is that after stating something like the above, to consider objections, giving someone else's view (typically without attribution) in as strong a form as possible for rebuttal.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Both the Vedānta and Nyāya schools were philosophers working off the basis of Hindu holy texts: The Vedas (some of which are as old as 1500 B.C.E. and mostly just describe ritual practices), The Upaniṣads (later Vedic texts that lay out most of the beliefs of modern Hinduism: think around 800 B.C.E.), and the &lt;em &gt;Bhagavad Gita &lt;/em &gt;(which wikipedia dates to the 2nd century B.C.E.; Phillips gave us a date of 400 during the episode; we discussed this text in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-204-23096992"&gt;ep. 204 &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Vedic schools (there are six of them) started as different interpretive strands which were then codified via the sutras, which are made up of terse aphorisms. Philosophers in these schools would subsequently write commentaries to flesh out the meanings of these aphorisms, and sometimes to digress into related philosophical topics. As with the Talmud, in these traditions a philosopher would append his commentary to previous commentaries on that sutra, such that, for instance, Vācaspati's Nyāya text has a title that can be literally translated as &lt;em &gt;Notes on the Gloss on the Commentary on Nyāya &lt;/em &gt;, because it includes his additions to the prior commentaries of Vātsyāyana (from the 2nd or 3rd century C.E.) and Uddyotakara (from the 6th century C.E.).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta" target="_blank"&gt;Vedāntins &lt;/a &gt;(Śaṅkara being one of the most famous) are often characterized as mere textual interpreters, given that the &lt;em &gt;Brahma-sūtra &lt;/em &gt;explicitly aims to systemize the teachings of the Upaniṣads. &lt;em &gt;God and the World's Arrangement &lt;/em &gt;takes pains to argue that Śaṅkara really was a philosopher, giving original, robust arguments and not just scriptural interpretations. Śaṅkara's sub-school within Vedānta is called Advaita or "non-dual," because their main tenet is that everything is Brahman: We are all underlyingly One, i.e. God. Like Buddhism, then, Advaita Vedānta implies that most of our experience and models of the world are ultimately illusory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discovering intellectually and then internalizing the fact that you are Brahman is the key to release from desire, suffering, and the cycle of rebirth. Some of this just involves meditation, but supporting this doctrine with reason is important too. So there's a puzzle here: If everything is God, then why say that there's one particular Creator who's the architect of it all? The Sanskrit word for the Creator here is īśvara, not Brahman, and Śaṅkara, for one clearly argued that it, like the self, is something that really exists as part of our world, or in God's case as part of science: It provides the best explanation for the way we find the world. Ultimately we're all conditioned by a veil of illusion that prevents us from seeing that we're really Brahman, and if we were to get beyond that to a truly divine point of view, then there would be no selves and no īśvara. However, since that point of view is not something that's available to us humans, we can truthfully say that there is a īśvara that created the natural world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Alongside this background, we need to understand for this first half of the book who Śaṅkara and Vācaspati were arguing against: The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya" target="_blank"&gt;Sāṃkhya school &lt;/a &gt;, which reads the Upaniṣads as saying that there's (instead of Brahman) a primordial matter that just shapes itself into the world spontaneously. Now, even though it's spontaneous, it does this according to the needs of people in their attempts to escape the cycle of rebirth. The &lt;em &gt;Brahma-sūtra &lt;/em &gt;and its commentators argue that this makes no sense: Primordial matter couldn't just move itself without already having some differentiation or something within itself. The Sāṃkhya cosmology says that this primordial matter is made up of the three &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%E1%B9%87a" target="_blank"&gt;guṇas.&lt;/a &gt;This term literally just means "attributes" or "qualities," but the gunas are specifically identified as pleasure (sattva), passionate activity (rajas), and dark inertia (tamas), i.e. they're moral qualities that express things about being stuck in the cycle of rebirth. The undifferentiated, primordial matter becomes particular things because human karma, like a magnet, reaches out over a distance to put the gunas out of balance, and so the particular furniture of our world appears! Our Vedāntins were mystified about how this could possibly work as described. Even though Sāṃkhya has provided a reason for the universe to form (i.e. to fulfill the demands of karma) and an alleged mechanism (the gunas being out of balance), there must be some divine intelligence that knows what karma demands and uses the levers of the universe (whether they be gunas or something else) to actually make it happen.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second half of the book we get an example of Nyāya natural theology, and the only text actually given is from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81caspati_Mi%C5%9Bra" target="_blank"&gt;Vācaspati Miśra &lt;/a &gt;. Yes, he was also a commentator to the &lt;em &gt;Brahma-sūtra &lt;/em &gt;, but he was an outlier comfortable in many schools: "one for whom all systems are his own," and so maybe not actually a member of any of those schools (though Phillips during the discussion says that the Vedāntin work was toward the end of his life and may represent his end point). In any case, Nyāya is an earlier school with the &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ny%C4%81ya_S%C5%ABtras" target="_blank"&gt;Nyāya-sūtra &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;probably being a few hundred compiled a few hundred years earlier than the &lt;em &gt;Brahma-sūtra &lt;/em &gt;. The word nyāya can be translated as "critical reasoning," and this school established Hinduism's epistemology and formal logic (building on and reacting to earlier &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dign%C4%81ga" target="_blank"&gt;Buddhist logic &lt;/a &gt;), including the syllogistic form described above. The Nyāya basic metaphysics was not Brahman or primordial matter made of gunas, but instead atoms, and so instead of īśvara emanating the world out of Himself, He had this eternally existing passive matter (the atoms) and allegedly put them in the arrangements that make up the world. The key to this argument is that God must be someone who knows these materials in order to put them together. The blind forces of physics or karma wouldn't by themselves have any such knowledge, so there must be a knower, and given that there is so much to know, that knower must be godlike.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Nyāya's opponents in this argument were Buddhists and another one of the Vedic schools, Mīmāṃsā, which ironically objected to a creator God because they were the most conservative school, and so worshipped the Vedas, i.e. the texts, themselves that they believed these Vedas to themselves be eternal. To posit an īśvara that created them would be irreverent! The relevant text from these opponent schools (by Dharmakīrti and Kumārila respectively) are given in an appendix to the book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So why did all this happen so far earlier than in the West? Well, primarily because of the popularity of Buddhism and other atheistic philosophies. Where in our Bhagavad-Gita episode, we were concerned that we were just reading a bunch of religious dogma, where the non-believers wouldn't be deemed worthy of serious response, by this point writers in these theistic schools couldn't take heresy for granted, because their numerous opponents thought themselves to be channeling divine revelation and referencing great sages as well. Another factor is the sheer mass of the Vedic texts and how little philosophical pretense is in them: It's typically possible to find a passage in some scripture or other that you can interpret in support of your favored position. Of course, since the scriptures were all agreed that there is reincarnation that reflects human karma, you're not going to find any of these Vedic philosophers denying that, so there were limits to the range of their views. Given that that world-view underlies an ethics that supported the caste system and a general attitude of "you deserve what you get," that groupthink was politically unfortunate.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hackettpublishing.com/god-and-the-world-s-arrangement-4447" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hackettpublishing.com/god-and-the-world-s-arrangement-4447" target="_blank"&gt;God and the World's Arrangement &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hackettpublishing.com/god-and-the-world-s-arrangement-4447" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Hackett's website &lt;/a &gt;and use the code SPRING21 before June 30 to get 20% off with free US or Canadian shipping.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Fyodor Dostoyevsky's philosophical novel from 1869.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Could a morally perfect person survive in the modern world? Is all this "modernity," which so efficiently computes our desires and provides mechanisms to fulfill them, actually suited to achieve human flourishing? Dostoyevsky (whose name, incidentally can correctly be spelled with either one "y" or two... the translation from the Russian alphabet means that that there's no standard spelling for any of his characters either) says no on both counts. Typical Russian existentialist!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So, in the line of D's great string of philosophical novels, &lt;em &gt;The Idiot &lt;/em &gt;comes after &lt;em &gt;Crime and Punishment &lt;/em &gt;(1866) (and his great appetizer-novella &lt;em &gt;Notes from Underground &lt;/em &gt;, 1864) but before &lt;em &gt;The Brothers Karamazov &lt;/em &gt;(1880), and its philosophical purpose is largely to raise questions that it does not answer. In the novel's "hero" Myshkin, D. intended to present a morally perfect human being, but Myshkin's open-heartedness leads to disaster for both him (nothing unexpected in that given his status as Christ figure) and those around him: People are not psychologically constituted to handle true goodness. We are a paradox, because (contra Plato) our freedom often necessitates that we turn away from "the good" that is set before us. This explains a lot of self-destructive behavior, and it means that utilitarian attempts to calculate what makes us happy and institute that as social policy will inevitably fail.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan are joined by Corey Mohler, author of &lt;a href="http://www.existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Existential Comics &lt;/a &gt;. We talk through the various characters (lest you get lost just as readers of D. often do, &lt;a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/idiot/characters.html" target="_blank"&gt;here's a reference list &lt;/a &gt;) and D's implicit and explicit claims about psychology, ethics, religion, and how our inevitable death affects all of us. D's concern is that society and modernity have undermined the machinery of our motivations, which is supposed to work through the naturalness of human contact, which D. thinks that traditional, peasant-based Russian Christianity facilitated (as opposed to Catholicism, which he declaims as a political enterprise). Modern culture directs us to pursue social status and money, which is so obviously empty that it then tends to push us toward nihilism, which is D's great fear: Without a firm foundation for values, we do things out of spite, or for no reason, and can rationalize even terrible crimes as being understandable given the criminal's economic or social situation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Of course, as a novelist, Dostoyevsky can create these very different characters with different philosophies, and it's never altogether clear when we're hearing D's actual view as opposed to one he's just playing out the implications of. Like Nietzsche, he certainly had a dim view of ordinariness, and saw the values as exhibited through status assignments in his society as pretty screwed up. But he doesn't start as Nietzsche does with atheism, nor does he address existentialism from a vantage that only makes sense for the religious à la Kierkegaard. We can all relate to the desire to cut through all the bullshit and react lovingly and authentically to people, and we all face the looming specter of death and how that potentially makes all of our projects meaningless.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375702245/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0375702245 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=303e95e4946e84e9a8578ab06e162d39" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2638" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dostoyevsky picture by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Get a &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/product/fyodor-dostoyevsky-t-shirt/" target="_blank"&gt;Dostoyevsky T-shirt &lt;/a &gt;!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Don Quixote" (acoustic, 2010) by Nik Kershaw, as interviewed on the &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/02/19/nem37-nik-kershaw/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music podcast #37 &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dylan goes on location to St. John's College Annapolis to talk with &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2qq2xFg" target="_blank"&gt;Stewart Umphrey &lt;/a &gt;about his book &lt;em &gt;Natural Kinds and Genesis: The Classification of Material Entities &lt;/em &gt;(2016), with Mark and Wes lobbing in questions remotely.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are general terms like "water" or "dog" or even "chair" just things that we made up to order the world we experience? Aristotle thought that some universals (not "chair," but the other two) constitute natural kinds, with an internal structure that explains their behavior. This kind of talk was replaced with the scientific revolution with talk of laws instead of kinds, but Stewart wants to revive this notion, as well as the activity of "natural philosophy," which was what folks like Descartes and Newton considered themselves to be doing, but which subsequently stopped being a thing when the natural sciences broke off from philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We all read chs. 1–5 and the epilogue, though Dylan also read chs. 6 and 7, which bring in concrete examples from biology and physics, so these are also discussed toward the end. Each chapter focuses on a different topic: Ch. 1 covers the preconditions of natural philosophy, which include a rejection (as an assumption for inquiry, not as a final conclusion) of any kind of idealism and acceptance that there really is an external world apart from our cognition. Ch. 2 then covers universals: Stewart thinks it reasonable to hypothesize that these are real contra nominalism that says we just make up all of the concepts we use to organize things. Ch. 3 gets to continuants, which are things that we see as existing over time, even though their location, or many of their properties may change; his example is a particular squirrel, whereas "water" as a mass wouldn't qualify (though a particular water molecule would). Again, after considering the available positions pro and con re. the existence of his subject, he concludes that it's a reasonable bet that there are legitimate continuants. Finally, in ch. 4 he gets to natural kinds, which he argues constitute the essence of a continuant type, e.g., what makes a squirrel or water molecule what it is. His view entails that each continuant can only be one natural kind, so while "squirrel" may end up to be a natural kind, then "animal" or other nested categorizations would not be; those would be just concepts of convenience, not ultimate parts of our ontology.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The purpose of caring about ontology in this way is to argue against the long-time scientific goal of reducing all of psychology to biology, all of biology to chemistry, and then to physics. Natural kinds would be irreducible elements in the ontology, not just things that came up in the course of the contingent (i.e., could have gone differently) history of science (contra Rorty). This is not to say that we might not be wrong about what we think the natural kinds are, but if there are some in the way that Stewart describes, then we can talk about real emergence in science: how biological organisms exhibit properties that can't be predicted by looking at things on a lower (e.g., chemical) level.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/03/05/dear-philosophers-please-get-over-your-science-envy-now-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's an article &lt;/a &gt;Wes wrote about the relationship between science and philosophy where he mentions Stewart.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you've got $45+ to spend on this, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1498531415/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1498531415 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=7776f09bbae73c42c4942364439b8c17" target="_blank"&gt;buy the book &lt;/a &gt;, or better yet, go &lt;a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/natural-kinds-and-genesis-the-classification-of-material-entities/oclc/951506664 &amp;amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"&gt;get it from your local academic library &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Update &lt;/strong &gt;: Order the book at &lt;a href="http://www.rowman.com/" target="_blank"&gt;www.rowman.com &lt;/a &gt;and use the code &lt;strong &gt;LEX30AUTH17 &lt;/strong &gt;, you'll get 30% off your order.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;A new limited (?) series is afoot in PEL-land: I'm indulging my interest in improv comedy as discussed in &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/05/17/nightcap-mid-may-2021/" target="_blank"&gt;our most recent Nightcap &lt;/a &gt;to pilot a new show featuring Bill Arnett, who &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ww3jTt" target="_blank"&gt;wrote the book on long-form improv &lt;/a &gt;, runs the &lt;a href="https://chicagoimprovstudio.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Chicago Improv Studio &lt;/a &gt;, and served as the game master Metamore on the &lt;a href="https://hellofromthemagictavern.com/episodes/2015/10/12/32-offices-bosses" target="_blank"&gt;Hello from the Magic Tavern spin-off series Offices and Bosses &lt;/a &gt;, wherein fantastical characters in a magical land role-play as besuited corporate drones.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The premise? Each of us wants to learn lessons from the other about our respective professions, fancying we have some natural talent in the area but with no prior formal training. So we each have some sort of simple lesson in mind and go head into a conversation wanting both to teach and learn, but also to &lt;em &gt;not take turns &lt;/em &gt;in accomplishing these tasks. The result is a chess match where we make up the rules as we go along and sometimes help each other cheat. Which lesson will produce the most profound effect in its hearer?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I can tell you already that this recording is not a one-off: We've already recorded #2 and are excited about the next one, already considering how we might add guests, actually do some scenes, and otherwise build on this simple formula. I really don't want to run a fourth podcast, but it looks like we may scale back our Pretty Much Pop recording schedule, and this thing requires the least formal preparation of any of my podcast endeavors yet. However, I'm taking this seriously as philosophy, and thinking hard about what lessons I can take from our 13 years of recording PEL. This particular recording includes our aftertalk (which may or may not be part of the eventual public release) where I talk a little about my approach: Much more than on PEL, I want to keep name-dropping to a minimum. If a philosophical idea is really applicable to life, then you should be able to just talk about it. Also, I'm dabbling in this format with the Socratic method: I don't want to just give a monologue, but to engage with someone who hasn't read what I have, hopefully helping him to give birth to the lesson, and being open (as happens in this discussion) to changing course as I go.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As a learner, already Pretty Much Pop has helped me at least learn a different and hopefully more interactive, less insulated mode of conversation, and one of my aims here is to learn to be a better listener, as well as to try to polish my comedy chops and act more creatively in the moment. Given that I have few notes to lean on in these discussions, don't know what Bill has in store for me, can't just rely on co-hosts to jump in and respond in my place, and am acting in an area where I'm a true noob, this is actually the most nerve-wracking of the podcasts I've attempted. I may well be actually bad, but hopefully that can be a source of entertainment in itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I'd love to hear your initial feedback on this (but will understand if it's not your thing or style or bag or entity, in which case maybe silence is the best policy).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks, -Mark Linsenmayer &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Art by Solmon Grundy. Editing by Tyler Hislop.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The theme music is from "Bankrupt" (foreshadowing the destination for acolytes of both philosophy and improv comedy), which I wrote as an naïve high schooler in 1989 and recorded it in 1993 with The MayTricks for the album &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://marklint.com/HappySongsAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Happy Songs Will Bring You Down &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on 4/27/21.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth is late, causing us to question Slack as a mode of communication a la Postman and Nightcap as a worthwhile creation. But then we go ahead and have a pretty darn interesting conversation that started with audio books, went through improv comedy, and then thought about how improv techniques could apply to doing philosophy. Finally Seth grouses about being a homeowner and Wes talks about &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/04/27/the-stoic-guide-to-happiness-a-new-course-by-wes/" target="_blank"&gt;his new Stoicism course &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A couple of the podcasts Mark mentioned are &lt;a href="https://hellofromthemagictavern.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Hello from the Magic Tavern &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/" target="_blank"&gt;My Brother, My Brother and Me &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/05/09/ep269-1-arendt-totalitarianism-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on “On the Nature of Totalitarianism” and &lt;em &gt;On the Origins of Totalitarianism &lt;/em &gt;, ch. 13 (both from around 1953).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We further discuss the logic of totalitarianism, how according to Arendt the ideology driving it becomes self-sustaining, generating ever-new enemies. How does this compare to (violence-free) scientism, logicism, objectivism, or anything else that tries to focus on indefeasible fidelity to a particular chain of reasoning? Of course, we get into modern politics and whether Arendt's descriptions have any direct relevance for critiquing Q-Anon or anti-racism or anything else. (&lt;a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/i-refuse-to-stand-by-while-my-students" target="_blank"&gt;This is the article that Wes pointed to &lt;/a &gt;as evidence of how anti-racism has become a fanatical religion that needs to control discourse.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth points out how in &lt;em &gt;Brave New World &lt;/em &gt;, we see eugenics used as a means to try to prevent the will to rebel that is the ever-present threat to a totalitarian regime. Perhaps &lt;em &gt;Brave New World &lt;/em &gt;as opposed to &lt;em &gt;1984 &lt;/em &gt;can serve as a corrective to some of Arendt's observations: How the broader existential phenomenon that makes us open to totalitarian regimes might also be motivating our amusing ourselves to death. We talk about Arendt's existentialism (apparently &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/french-existentialism/" target="_blank"&gt;she did write directly about this &lt;/a &gt;; perhaps we'll read it another time).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On “On the Nature of Totalitarianism” (1953) and &lt;em &gt;On the Origins of Totalitarianism &lt;/em &gt;, ch. 13 (added in 1953), featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Totalitarianism was epitomized in fiction by &lt;em &gt;1984 &lt;/em &gt;but enacted in the real world in Russia under Stalin and what would have likely been the end-point of Germany under Hitler had he been allowed to stay in power. Is this form of government just a particularly acute kind of tyranny as theorized about by political philosophy at least as far back as Aristotle?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Arendt said no: Totalitarianism represents a fundamentally new form, unique to the modern age, and a new and pressing danger given economic and technological forces that isolate people while making it possible for a government to intrude into their lives to an unprecedented degree.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Arendt's essays (the two that we read cover largely the same ground, with a few different points of emphasis) draw on the analytical framework of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-239-invents-35212889" target="_blank"&gt;Montesquieu &lt;/a &gt;, who identifies a psychological state as the underlying ground of each type of government: Citizens and leaders in a democracy need to be motivated by political virtue, i.e. the love of laws and country. Participants in a monarchy are ruled by honor, and in a tyranny the ruled and ruler alike are driven by fear. (It's fear that drives the tyrant to remove all opposition.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While a totalitarian state will use fear as a means to get going, its internal logic is not dependent on fear or even on a cult of personality. Rather, it is built around a single principle, which can be any number of principles from anywhere on the political spectrum, but it importantly must be a totalizing principle that interprets all of history as progress toward its desired end. For the Nazis, that end was racial purity, whereas for Stalinists, it was a classless society. These ends can be and are held in non-totalitarian political contexts, but if taken with deadly seriousness, they become the animating force for a society, with all individuals and their actions subordinated to that end. There can be no psychological motivating force to this type of government, because it necessarily squashes individual human motivations. The society thinks for you, and so you are just moved without motivation at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is Arendt being overly dramatic here? In &lt;em &gt;1984 &lt;/em &gt;, for instance, we see that total cooption of the individual's mind is the &lt;em &gt;goal &lt;/em &gt;, but even in that work of fiction, is this goal ever fully achieved? Can there really be true totalitarianism of the sort described, or is such a project inevitably doomed because it goes against human nature? Perhaps we can identify and counter totalitarian tendencies, but it's not necessary that we grant that the individual human will can actually be extinguished.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The question is whether there is a particularly totalitarian teleology that actually undermines the principle and its stated goals. A committed communist or racist will want the goals of their ideology to be achieved with as little fuss as possible. If all the objectionable individuals would simply ship off to some other country, then the objective would be attained. According to Arendt, though, the means become the end: A totalitarian regime uses terror and murder not to achieve the end, but to keep itself in power by taking over the minds of the populace. New enemies must always be found; the goal must never be actually achieved. The world must necessarily be conquered so that the principle can reign in its every corner. Because the regime does not always know exactly who its opponents are, it must choose arbitrarily those who will this week be made an example of. This means that fealty to the regime is not enough to ensure safety. Unlike in a tyranny where fear keeps the populace in line, there is no being "in line" with a totalitarian regime; the concepts of guilt and innocence lose their meaning. Terror is not a motivator but a stabilizer; someone in terror cannot make choices at all, cannot even think.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is Arendt right that such a cycle can get going and includes the mechanisms to exist stably? Or is what she's describing just something that's gotten seriously out of control so as to start to eat itself? Fascism is an us-them mentality that draws upon and strengthens familiar tribal ties. If a fascist state starts killing off members of its tribe randomly, does that actually hold the tribe together more tightly, or is it corrosive of these bonds?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whatever the ontological status of this phenomenon of totalitarianism might be, Arendt's comments about its attempted affects on the public and private spheres provide an interesting supplement to what we learned about them in considering &lt;em &gt;The Human Condition &lt;/em &gt;in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-125-hannah-on-50433010" target="_blank"&gt;our episode 125 &lt;/a &gt;. Our human needs include both a sphere for public engagement and one for deep, private contemplation. These two spheres require each other, and they require freedom of thought and speech, which are what the regime seeks to foreclose.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In a government of laws, these laws circumscribe the realm of the public and thereby leave the rest (the private sphere) for individuals to work out and grow in. A totalitarian state doesn't have steady laws, but only the law of history as dictated by the ideology. It sets and end and says that anything that the rulers deem needed in pursuit of that end is justified, and any efforts that are irrelevant to that end are blasphemous. The division between public and private is thus erased.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Arendt distinguished between isolation, loneliness, and solitude. If you're isolated, then you can't act because no one will act with you; you're politically impotent. Loneliness is feeling like you've been deserted by all human companionship. You can be with people (cowering together from a tyrant) and so not be lonely even though you're isolated in this sense, and you can be acting politically in concert with people (the members of your tribe) and yet feel lonely. Isolation, however, is good in limited doses, in that you can't really get much done if people are constantly with you. We leave the political realm to create something, whether material or an idea. That good kind of isolation is solitude, and for it to be healthy, you need to be able to come back together with other people to see if that idea makes sense or the creation is good and useful. When solitude turns to loneliness, that's when a person's thoughts proceed unchecked by other people. Specifically, this is when an ideological thought can become so dominant its own internal logic can seem inevitable and all-encompassing. You might, in solitude, read some Marx and think that it expresses something important, but in discussing it critically with others, you will at least see powerful logistic (and philosophical) hurdles that will bring into question whether and how it should be enacted. In loneliness, no one provides this perspective and so the logic of communism's historic inevitability dictates (according to Arendt) that instead of waiting for history to cause the bourgeoise to naturally lose their power, it seems rational to help history along by killing them. Philosophers, who need solitude to do their work, always run the risk of turning lonely, and for their thoughts to become radicalized in this sort of way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Arendt diagnosed the modern age as lonely to an unprecedented degree, and so people who want to belong will be attracted to such ideologies, and so to a false sense of solidarity to others who believe in the same cause. A totalitarian regime seeks to bind us together so closely, as instruments of the ideology working in the world, that we're not exhibiting genuine agency at all, so we're isolated even though it looks like we're working together, lonely because the private sphere in which our loneliness could be relieved has been obliterated and replaced by the ideology, incapable of solitude in any sense. Still, every new birth counts as a potential threat to keeping humanity in lockstep like this. This not only gives ever-fresh potential enemies for the regime to rail against, but represents a perpetual instability in such regimes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can buy "On the Nature of Totalitarianism" as part of &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3hfDvWX" target="_blank"&gt;Essays in Understanding, 1930-1954 &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="http://hs.umt.edu/ghr/documents/152ArendtOnTheNatureofTotalitarianismAnEssayinUnderstanding-Copy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;or read the essay online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the film &lt;em &gt;I Am Not Your Negro &lt;/em &gt;and the essays "Notes of a Native Son" (1955) and &lt;em &gt;The Fire Next Time &lt;/em &gt;(1963).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Baldwin is a go-to figure at this point in discussions of race; his essays, stories, and speeches provide a key touchstone in discussing how racism has warped our culture. So how do we translate his testimony into philosophical theory? When he talks about the psychological/sociological maladies of both black and white folks resulting from the overt racism of his day, to what extent do his insights apply to us now, when racism has become more subtle?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The full foursome are rejoined by Law Ware to shed new light on our discussion from ep. 161. We focus on Baldwin's middle way between MLK's love and Malcolm X's rage and his critique of the American dream.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the novel &lt;em &gt;1984 &lt;/em &gt;(1949) and the essays “Politics and the English Language” (1946) and “Notes on Nationalism” (1945).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the relation between language and totalitarianism? In &lt;em &gt;1984 &lt;/em &gt;, Orwell presents us with a society where the ruling powers have mastered the art of retaining power, and one element of this involves "Newspeak," where the vocabulary is purposely limited to the point where subversive sentiments can't be expressed. And if you can't say it, you can't really think it either, so the "thought crime" that begins the protagonist's journey of despair would be impossible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get some context from the two essays: "Politics and the English Language" tells us that when we parrot metaphors and other phrases given to us ready-made by those in power (or anyone else), we cease to authentically think. "Notes on Nationalism" describes the difference between patriotism, i.e., authentic pride in your locality, and nationalism, which should really be called factionalism, which involves putting all your efforts (à la Beauvoir's "serious man") in the service of country or party or whatever.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;em &gt;1984 &lt;/em &gt;, citizens are expected to surrender their individuality to the party (i.e., the state), and the full foursome is here to talk about exactly how that's supposed to work in the story and who counts as a citizen ("outer party") vs. a prole (whom those in power starve of the means to revolt but don't bother to indoctrinate on an individual level). So, was this Orwell's version of Marx's theory of history, i.e., through some kind of Darwinism of ideas, factions that exhibit these kinds of defensive mechanisms will inevitably rise to the top (note that this happens to all three of the world's empires in the story, though each of them had different starting ideologies)? Or was he engaging in satire, or just warning us of where certain tendencies of his day's socialism might lead if left unchecked? (Note that he was a dedicated socialist himself.) Or is this just a thought experiment to show what kind of organization one &lt;em &gt;would &lt;/em &gt;need to ensure continuous power?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What Orwell describes is extreme: purposefully and constantly revised history to reflect current party priorities, constant surveillance and even entrapment to "educate" citizens to love the state (which in the case of our protagonist breaks him to the point of his being essentially useless to the state's efforts), the necessity of "double-think" that involves citizens both purposely lying to themselves and then forgetting that they have done so, and finally, the overt avowal by the rulers (the "inner party") that they pursue power purely for power's sake, not for the sake of some good apart from power. Given this extremity, could the depicted society possibly plot out a realistic trajectory from our current one, or even amount to a particularly illuminating thought experiment?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Orwell has thankfully helped inoculate against disingenuous political speech, such as calling the Republicans' current plan "The American Health Care Act" when it is in fact designed to undermine care for many (I pick this example only for its recency; there are many others available of various partisan varieties). Does lying by our government in this way, or trying to restrict speech to only "acceptable" modes, or working up fear of an external, mostly illusory threat to keep the citizens in line… Do these measures represent a slippery slope to totalitarianism, to anything like the world that Orwell describes? Or is calling such things "Orwellian" really just a cliché of exactly the sort that Orwell himself would object to?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451524934/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0451524934 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=00a87ff24bd87ee2ebe953621963cb35" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100021.txt" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

What's the relation between ethics and politics? Can a bunch of aphorisms written in the distant past for an unapologetically hierarchical culture emphasizing traditional rituals actually give us relevant, welcome advice on these matters?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the &lt;em &gt;Consolation &lt;/em &gt;, written as Boethius awaited execution in 524 CE.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Do bad things really happen to good people? Boethius, surprisingly, says no, for Stoic (anything that can be taken away can't be of central importance; you can't lose your virtue in this way), Aristotelian (all things tend toward the good, and the best thing for a person is achieving his or her innate potential, which is to be virtuous), and Christian (God's unknowable plan means that even the stuff that seems bad really isn't) reasons.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Boethius imagines Lady Philosophy herself coming to him in his cell and reminding him of the philosophical perspective that (following Plato) gives him access to a higher realm of being than the one inhabited by goods like reputation and bodily freedom. This results in arguments like bad luck is really good, because when things go bad, that's when two-faced Fortune reveals herself as the inconstant villain she is. Also (this should be familiar from Plato's &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;), even if someone wicked &lt;em &gt;seems &lt;/em &gt;happy, by definition wickedness rules out true happiness, and virtue is its own reward. Goods like pleasure, fame, and riches promise a sort of completion, but they don't deliver; really, what we're looking for is integrity of self, which is what virtue offers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To hear more about the famous "How can we have free will when God knows all?" part of the book, check out John Marenbon's appearance on &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/boethius-marenbon" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 119 &lt;/a &gt;of the History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in 20th Century America &lt;/em &gt;(1998).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes for efficacious progressive politics? Rorty has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/books/richard-rortys-1998-book-suggested-election-2016-was-coming.html?_r=0" target="_blank"&gt;cited much recently &lt;/a &gt;as predicting the rise of Trump. In this book, he gives us a history of the political left, and draws a dividing line between old-time reformist leftist intellectuals like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair" target="_blank"&gt;Upton Sinclair &lt;/a &gt;who worked for real change and post-'60s cultural critics like &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/01/24/the-fate-of-slavoj-zizek/" target="_blank"&gt;Slavoj Žižek &lt;/a &gt;who seem to believe that we are past hope. Rorty thinks we leftists need to reconnect with national pride, which he considers not a matter of jingoism or reverence for the government in power, but of hope in the American project, which is always being achieved. Our goal is a classless, casteless society: a society that produces less unnecessary suffering than any others and is the best means to the creation of a greater diversity of full, imaginative, daring individuals.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This episode serves to bridge our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/01/16/ep156-philosophy-politics-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;recent political discussion &lt;/a &gt;with the previous episode on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/01/01/ep155-rorty-epistemology-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Rorty's epistemology &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to Rorty's diagnosis, prior to the '60s, leftists worked with groups like labor unions to achieve concrete reforms. But with the Vietnam War, a new generation condemned the Old Left as collaborators and erected a high bar for moral purity that labeled anyone not explicitly Marxist as part of the problem. The effect, ironically for the Marxists, has been to shift attention away from economic issues toward social issues, and while it's been great that we've achieved such huge advances in cutting back on racism, sexism, and other types of discrimination, this focus on cultural issues has left a gaping void ripe for a right-wing demagogue to sweep in, claiming to represent the economic interests of the people.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One characteristic of this cultural Left that Rorty objects to is its moral absolutism, and here's where the connection to Rorty's epistemology comes in. For Rorty, thinking of racism and the like in absolutist terms is both false and counter-productive. It's false because morality, like truth, is a matter of historically shifting consensus, and it's counter-productive because it focuses on shaming violators, on humiliating them, and not on actually convincing them, on building a coalition based on a shared vision of a future free from both inequality and sadism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This discussion features the full foursome, with Wes using Rorty to continue outlining his prescriptions for America and Seth taking Rorty's diagnosis of the Left personally. Dylan is inspired, while Mark thinks that Rorty's argument doesn't really hang together: You don't need all this relativism stuff to argue for hope in America (it may actually be counter-productive), and while many Leftists are politically disengaged, it's certainly not a fair characterization of the many demonstrators we've just seen (note that this was recorded earlier in January, before the demonstrations).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674003128/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674003128 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=410937655e362500d220e795de471475" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/rorty/rorty_achieving_country_ch1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read the first chapter online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "America Back" by Jill Sobule, as featured in &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/06/29/nem18-jill-sobule/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music episode 18 &lt;/a &gt;.

Rorty says that while of course psychology has interesting things to say, any specifically philosophical effort is doomed. Why? Because there is no fixed point outside of the "knowledge language game" that provides an ultimate grounding.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Rorty draws on Sellars (&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50992909" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 154 &lt;/a &gt;) to say that there is no sensory "given" or primary intuition of reason that can serve this function, and also on Quine (&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-66-quine-on-17045937" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 66 &lt;/a &gt;) who argued that there are no "analytic truths," that even the truths of logic are merely central to our web of belief, not immovable foundations.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Rorty is arguing for a coherence view of truth, where propositions can only be justified by how well they fit with the other propositions, not by their correspondence to the world outside of human discourse. He thinks that since Locke and Kant, we have come to think of this philosophical project of figuring out the roles of intuition (what we sense) vs. concepts (what our minds do to make sense of this sense data) as an inescapable problem, but no: As with the related issue of inner mind vs. outer world (as discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50992799" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 153 &lt;/a &gt;), this has been a matter of our idiosyncratic history, and a proper reading of the ancient Greeks will not find this paradigm of epistemic theorizing at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan reflect on whether Rorty's pragmatic objections hold any water and whether he's just a dirty, stinking relativist! &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691141320/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691141320 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=9f3ff7564cd9da9abe9dd4c17ddfd399" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/rorty/rorty_PMN_full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "The Ghosts Are Alright" from The Bye-Bye Blackbirds (&lt;em &gt;Houses and Homes &lt;/em &gt;, 2008), as discussed on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/12/27/nem32-bradley-skaught/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #32 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally posted 1/1/17.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind" (1956).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is knowledge based on a "foundation," as Descartes, Locke, et al. thought? Sellars says no. Sixteenth-century empiricists thought that we have some indubitable perceptions: Even though I may not be &lt;em &gt;absolutely sure &lt;/em &gt;that there's a red object in front of me, I can be sure that &lt;em &gt;there seems to be &lt;/em &gt;such an object. The "red appearance" seems to be something I'm directly acquainted with, and maybe if I compare such experiences, I can come up with generalizations, and so eventually get to empirical science.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what is it exactly that I'm aware of in such a case? If this kind of experience is really basic, really supposed to provide the basis of the rest of knowledge, then knowing it can't involve also knowing those other things, on pain of circularity. So what I'm aware of can't be the truth of a sentence, which would require that I have a lot of prior knowledge of language and of the logical space in which "red" sits relative to other colors, other adjectives, space and time, etc. So it must be a wordless kind of thing, much like a (non-color-blind) animal would have, or a baby.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Knowledge, whether scientific or otherwise, is made up of statements, claims, propositions, which I believe to be true, and which are in fact true. To give reasons for believing a proposition, to use logic, you need other propositions, so the basic, foundational pieces of knowledge would have to be propositions too, if a foundationalist picture of knowledge is going to work. So the basic foundations of knowledge have to be propositions, but we just said that they &lt;em &gt;can't &lt;/em &gt;be propositions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;That's the crux of Sellars's argument: Knowledge can't be foundationalist in this way at all. There are no basic, indubitable propositions that provide support for everything else. Instead, these propositions must come in packs: Just becoming linguistically competent means we've already accepted numerous claims, and though, yes, observation sentences provide support for generalizations, the generalizations (in a different way) provide us the ability to have individual, new experiences.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;And note that while the argument was cast against empiricism, it works even more quickly against rationalism, i.e., the claim that there are basic truths of reason that ground everything else. Any "truth of reason," again, is obviously a proposition, a sentence, and to be even understood involves buying into a whole conceptual scheme. Even something as innocent as "A=A" means that you understand what identity is, as it occurs in real-world objects, and yet we understand that even if "red ball" and "red ball" both refer to the same object, we know that "red" does not equal "ball," so we understand predication, and language use, and the social system in which language use occurs.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan are joined by &lt;a href="http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/graduate/files/Dallman_Corrected.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence "Dusty" Dallman &lt;/a &gt;, who claims that Sellars is the most important 20th-century American philosopher.

Rorty says this view of the mind as the thing closest to us, the only thing we can really know with certainty, came from Descartes, with only hints of it earlier in the tradition. Before that, people didn't think of the mind as an "inner realm" and mental elements like pains as particular things that don't seem to be of the same type as events in the physical world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the solution is not to deny that the mental exists like a behaviorist, or to insist that mental terms actually refer to brain states or that mental events and brain states are two aspects of the same underlying substance: Rather than bridge the "ontological gap" between mental and physical in this way, Rorty would rather we back up and reject the conceptual system that gives rise to this apparent problem in the first place.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691141320/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691141320 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=9f3ff7564cd9da9abe9dd4c17ddfd399" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/rorty/rorty_PMN_full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan are joined by &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/authors.stephen_metcalf.html" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Metcalf &lt;/a &gt;of Slate's Culture Gabfest podcast, a former pupil of Rorty's.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Democracy is in peril! So said Tocqueville in 1835 and 1840 when &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_America" target="_blank"&gt;Democracy is America &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;was published, and so would he likely say now. Democracy is always just one demagogue away from stripping us of our liberties, though certain structural and cultural features can make that more or less likely.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Tocqueville liked our spirit of volunteerism, our civic activeness, our energy and inventiveness and competitiveness, and the pervasiveness of religion (at the time) in American culture. But he didn't like our groupthink, our tendencies toward materialism and caring only about our own small circle (what he called "individualism"), our lack of philosophical curiosity, and was in favor of a strong separation between church and state. He thought that people in a democracy value equality over freedom, and that in the absence of a strong spiritual countervailing force, we'd spend more energy pursuing material comfort and so would be more likely to allow a tyrant who promises this to us to take control. He also feared the rise of a new aristocracy out of the business world, with bosses becoming the new de facto lords. Then again, he also feared a race war and thought for sure that if the South tried to secede, the federal government would be too weak to prevent this, so there's that.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This discussion was recorded live from Brown University 10/27/16 with Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan engaging the political moment and with an audience during the Q &amp;amp;A portion at the end.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226805360/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226805360 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=90b9ceda5dadbfe88f78ff939b7518fc" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/tocqueville/alexis/democracy/complete.html" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France" target="_blank"&gt;Reflections on the Revolution in France &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1790).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Writing after the revolution but before the terror, Burke was alarmed at intellectual fads in England that paid homage to the principles driving what happened in France: the right of people to choose their own government, to elect their leaders, and depose those that violate citizens' rights. So, given that these principles have won the day, why would we possibly care about what a reactionary monarchist had to say against them? Why is Burke revered as an intellectual grandfather to modern conservatism?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Well, first, given what happened in France with the terror, Burke's worries were warranted. While he thought that revolution was justified in extreme circumstances (when "necessity" dictates), the ground for such a revolution (as with the so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;Glorious Revolution &lt;/a &gt;of 1688 in England) should be an appeal something more ancient, more well-grounded by tradition. The idea should not be to treat the revolution as an excuse to devise a new, ideal government from scratch based on abstract principles. Live, flesh-and-blood people and their real concerns are more important than these abstract ideals, and societies are not laboratories for experimentation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While we equate political freedom with rights and well-being, Burke thinks that democracy leads to mob rule and the suppression of rights, and that an emphasis on abstract rights can prevent the government from protecting what he considers our real rights as citizens for protection by the state. While he thinks that people's interests need to be represented, and that corruption needs to be remedied and beneficial reforms adopted, the most important thing is stability, and society's wisdom built up over the ages is our best guide to this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Burke thinks that law and culture are intertwined, and while it's possible to change laws on a dime, this will have negative consequences unless supporting social structures, created through tradition and maintained through religion and mores, provide necessary support. Liberty needs the support of wisdom and virtue, and Burke admires the honor-based motivation of a noble class that already has enough money, whereas he thinks that the merchant-types put in charge of the French assembly have been incentivized to use the government for their own financial gain.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan cogitate on Burke's lush, highly repetitive prose and try to figure out what this text has to teach us about good government today. For example, Burke thinks too much idealism leaves us indifferent to real and present (e.g., Trumpian) danger, so DON'T EVEN THINK OF NOT VOTING.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199539022/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199539022 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=c95c1663bcbb47b11e4c4a14a651c682" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/burke/revfrance.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Hard Times of Old England" from Peter Knight's Gigspanner (from &lt;em &gt;Layers of Ages &lt;/em &gt;, 2015); listen to Mark's interview with Peter on Nakedly Examined Music ep. 27 at &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/10/30/nem27-peter-knight-steeleye-span/" target="_blank"&gt;nakedlyexaminedmusic.com &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Burke picture is by &lt;a href="http://www.instagram.com/sterlingbartlett" target="_blank"&gt;Sterling Bartlett &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 11/5/16.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What do we owe the poor? Mark and Wes interview perhaps &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer" target="_blank"&gt;the world's most influential living philosopher &lt;/a &gt;for an hour, then the full PEL foursome discusses.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The focus is the newly reissued/repackaged 1971 essay "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," which argues that just as we would regard is as unethical to fail to save a drowning child because you don't want to ruin your expensive shoes, so it's unethical to let someone die of preventable illness or hunger when an expensive-shoe-level donation would save that life. The new publication includes supplementary essays, and Peter has spent much of the rest of his career elaborating and arguing for and preaching about the practical upshot of this essay, which is that our priorities in this consumerist society are very out of whack: We don't give nearly enough to charitable causes, and we don't judge our charitable giving by the standard of helping the most people in the most substantial ways.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Peter is well known as a utilitarian (we covered him briefly back in our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/09/18/episode-9-utilitarian-ethics-what-should-we-do/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 9 &lt;/a &gt;where we discussed that ethical theory), and characterizes the key insight of the moral point of view as impartialism: no one individual's interests take precedence over anyone else's from the point of view of the universe. Don't play favorites. While there are certainly utilitarian advantages of everyone being responsible first and foremost for their own children, the lives of two stranger children will still outweigh the life of your single child, and certainly (and this is the conflict we actually face) fulfilling your child's taste for luxury is much less important than saving the lives of many stranger children.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0190219203/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0190219203 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a61f58d9a9bcb590f41caebbd4091fbc" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm" target="_blank"&gt;read the original essay online &lt;/a &gt;.

Aristotle thinks that friends are necessary for the good life (i.e., eudaimonia or happiness, which is the goal of ethics), and that the only true friends, as opposed to those who merely entertain us or are useful to us, are virtuous people. They're the only ones who won't outlive their usefulness, whom you can really count on.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the other hand, the number one virtue (according to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50938838" target="_blank"&gt;our last episode on this book &lt;/a &gt;) is reason, and the good life is the contemplative one, which doesn't sound all that social, so how do reason and friendship connect?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan are joined by PEL blogger &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/author/a-sandoiu/" target="_blank"&gt;Ana Sandoiu &lt;/a &gt;to try to figure out why we all love each other (but just as friends!): is it because of our uniqueness, or is it because of some generic characteristic like virtue, as Aristotle seems to be saying?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ana's translation of the book is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226026752/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226026752 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=7e356ff203ee98c126cf2530e8b1cdc7" target="_blank"&gt;this one &lt;/a &gt;by Robert Bartlett and Susan Collins.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "A Few Gone Down" from The MayTricks'&lt;em &gt;Happy Songs Will Bring You Down &lt;/em &gt;(1994). &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/HappySongsAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Download the whole album for free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle picture by Sterling Bartlett.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 10/2/16.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the &lt;em &gt;Nichomachean Ethics &lt;/em &gt;(ca. 350 BCE), books 6–7.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is intelligence just one thing? Aristotle picks out a number of distinct faculties, some of which are relevant to ethics, and he uses these to explain Plato's puzzle of how someone can clearly see what the good for him is, and yet fail to pursue it due to weakness of the will.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This episode continues our discussion from way back in &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/07/16/episode-5-aristotle%E2%80%99s-nichomachean-ethics/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 5 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This time around Mark, Wes, and Dylan talk a lot about the Greek terminology. For a cheat sheet on that, see &lt;a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rcherubi/nevi.htm" target="_blank"&gt;this page &lt;/a &gt;, esp. part D., which goes through the different faculties (&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexis" target="_blank"&gt;hexeis &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;). The only one you should really remember in this context is &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phronesis" target="_blank"&gt;phronesis &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, or practical wisdom, which involves both having the right goals and having the know-how re: what to do to pursue those goals. (By contrast, see &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/08/02/dread-wonder-and-the-art-of-persuasion/" target="_blank"&gt;Ana's post here &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;deinotes &lt;/em &gt;, or cleverness, which leaves out the having the right goals part.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199213615/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199213615 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=f7654a0ccffebbb64c609b6e67530c7e" target="_blank"&gt;the W.D.

What individuates one person from another, making us into selves instead of just part of the causal net of events? Why would someone possibly think that these are real, non-obvious questions that need to be addressed? Levinas gives us a phenomenological progression from the "there is," terrifyingly undifferentiated Being, to becoming an individual through "hypostasis," which is becoming an existent through a voyage out to the world and back to oneself. But this existing makes us solitary, not only in this weird ontological sense of being a distinct thing, but in a concrete, emotional sense. Overcoming this requires grasping the Other as a real Other, not as an object to fulfill our desires or get in our way. Really understanding this at our core takes some doing, and in the process, we gain a mature sense of time and of death, so, good for us!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This episode follows up on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50891750" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 145 &lt;/a &gt;, where we introduced some of these themes and gave Levinas's pitch for ethical responsibility.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0820702331/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0820702331 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=6bcefce4b864bed54674df9bf110884b" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/7/7f/Levinas_Emmanuel_Time_and_the_Other_1987.Pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Levinas image by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Call on You" by Mark Lint from from the 1993 &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;album &lt;em &gt;Spanish Armada: Songs of Love and Related Neuroses &lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Ethics as First Philosophy" (1984).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;More existentialist ethics, with a Jewish twist this time! Seth rejoins Mark and Wes to discuss this difficult essay, with a bit of "Time and the Other" (1948) and "There Is: Existence Without Existents" (1946) thrown in, too.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Levinas thinks that the whole train of Western thought with the advance of science and all has left us too aggressive, too self-asserting, as a matter of our culturally held ontology, and that this obscures our view of our fundamental relationship to other people, to time, and to death. However, we do have, right there in our everyday experience, a model of "non-intentional consciousness" in the awareness we have of ourselves when we're not thinking about ourselves, when we're absorbed in some activity instead of self-reflecting.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"Intentional consciousness" makes whatever we're conscious of an object. It's like we're eating it, reducing it to some element in our minds. But if we can get at the more passive kinds of awareness we already have, we can see that "knowledge of" is not really the proper mode of dealing with another person, who is fundamentally Other and can't be reduced without falsification to an object. Ontologically (and propably developmentally), this passive way of relating is primary; it trumps all of our assertions of self and of mastery over our world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So that's supposed to be a phenomenological account of the primacy of ethics over any other kind of philosophy, over any thought whatsoever. This is interesting to compare with the account of Levinas's contemporary Simone de Beauvoir, whose ethics we just covered in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-140-beauvoir-50859380" target="_blank"&gt;episode 140 &lt;/a &gt;. She was arguing (in a Kantian sort of way) that ethics is contemporaneous with willing, which is of course prior to any of our particular projects or values. But Levinas is trying to make it even more primordial, with the passive experience that comes prior to willing. In both cases, existentialism is trying to say that a proper phenomenological evaluation of yourself is supposed to reveal that yes, you are subject to this obligation toward others. For Levinas, this obligation is total, whatever that means (our discussion, like the essay, is focused on the foundations of ethics, not so much on what exactly we're supposed to do given this obligation).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0631164472/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0631164472 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=9beab0bf2b7ac5d7f91748e77e4a22d6" target="_blank"&gt;The Levinas Reader &lt;/a &gt;, which contains all of the essays we read, or &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/f/f9/The_Levinas_Reader_1989.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "To Valerie" from The MayTricks' &lt;em &gt;So Chewy &lt;/em &gt;(1993). &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/SoChewyAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Download the album for free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Levinas picture by Olle Halvars Franzen.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 8/19/16.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

What role should we allow anger to play in our public life? Should systems of punishment be strictly impartial, or should they be retributive, i.e., expressive of public anger? Nussbaum thinks that anger necessarily involves the desire for payback, and that this is nearly always unhelpful. We should instead use anger (or rather, change it into "transition anger") to look toward the future and prevent future harm.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whether in personal relationships, dealings with acquaintances, or in setting policy, anger as desire for payback tends only to further exacerbate bad situations. And "transactional forgiveness," i.e., debasing someone and making them jump through hoops before you accept an apology, is a historical relic that also just expresses hostility. But what about social justice; can anger help us focus on achieving that? Doesn't punishment need to express our collective anger against undesirable behaviors and those who perform them?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Martha is an engaging and provocative speaker, and Mark, Wes, and Dylan were happy to get to talk with her.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the later Platonic dialogue (ca. 360 BC). What is a sophist? Historically, these were foreign teachers in Ancient Greece who taught young people the tools of philosophy and rhetoric, among other things, and especially they claimed to teach virtue.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this dialogue, "the Eleatic Stranger" (i.e., not Socrates, who is present but wholly silent after the first couple of pages) is trying to figure out what a sophist really is, and in the process is showing us a new procedure for defining a word, which he calls the method of division. This is sort of like 20 questions, where you start with "animal, vegetable, or mineral?" The difference, of course, being that in 20 questions, one player already knows the answer, and you might ask whether it makes any sense at all to use such a method when you really don't know what the thing is that you're looking for. If you don't know what a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropoda" target="_blank"&gt;gastopod &lt;/a &gt;is, then you can't start to answer that by asking yourself what general type of thing it is. But with "sophist," or any other term (e.g., justice, knowledge) that Plato concerns himself with, of course you know enough to start the inquiry, and the point is to get more philosophically precise. So a better example might be "what is a whale," where you start with the animal you can see and end up classifying it as mammal as opposed to fish.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Stranger ends up classifying the sophist in several ways corresponding to various properties ascribed to sophists (Is he someone who hunts for the souls and money of young people? Is he someone who divides people from their confused beliefs? Is he someone who creates false beliefs in people's heads?) but ends up having to explore the concept of falsity, and its metaphysical correlate, non-being. The "Eleatic" in "Eleatic Stranger" is supposed to connote Parmenides, a Presocratic philosopher who famously claimed that all existence is really One, with no real change. This means that all the variation among the things we see is really illusion: all is Being, and there can be no real thing as a lack of Being. Among the many paradoxes for language coming out of this view is that we can't even rationally say that "non-being does not exist," because in doing so we're using "non-being" as the subject of the sentence—i.e., as an object, i.e., as something that in some sense exists and has this property of not existing. And this property of "not existing" of course means "partakes of non-being." So, saying that unicorns don't exist is a matter of attributing this paradoxical property to these non-things.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If Plato/the Stranger wants to claim that the sophist is a liar, then he has to make sense contra Parmenides of the idea that a sentence can be false, i.e., can refer to a state of affairs that IS NOT, that lacks being. Non-being has to in some sense be a real thing. The eventual solution in this difficult dialogue is that the concept of "other" makes talking about non-being make sense. A unicorn is not really a non-thing; it's just a thing that's different than any of the things that are in the world, or a better way of putting it is that the situation of there existing a unicorn is other than any of the situations that hold. Falsity just means "other than truth."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So, how does all this talk of sophistry vs. philosophy relate to our intellectual climate today? Why would anyone believe Parmenides in the first place, such that it's worth our time to refute him? And is this definition by the method of division just a gimmick, where for you to come up with appropriate grounds for division, you really already have to know the answer to your question in advance? Mark, Wes, and Dylan try to ferret their way through these issues in this fast-paced, comparatively difficult discussion.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Socrates hangs out in the country flirting with his buddy Phaedrus. And what is this "Platonic" love you've all heard about? Well, you use the enticement of desire not to rush toward fulfillment, but to get all excited about talking philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Phaedrus starts off reading a speech by renowned orator &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysias" target="_blank"&gt;Lysias &lt;/a &gt;(actually Plato's invention parodying the style of this real guy) about love: Love is a form of madness, where people do things they then regret after love fades. Therefore, it's better to hang out with someone who does NOT love you, i.e. some friend who's concerned with your interests instead of fulfilling his addled desires.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Socrates critiques both this position and the speech itself. We get to learn about what makes for a good persuasive speech (one point: don't put the sentences in random order!) and see both how Socrates would make the same point Lysias does but better, and then what Socrates's true view and preferred presentation is: This takes the form of a long myth that involves a chariot, and the structure of the soul, and how beauty causes us to remember a heavenly world. And after all this, we get to hear more about rhetoric and how back-and-forth, in-person philosophical exchange is way better than reading books.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan are joined by &lt;a href="http://greatdiscourses.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Great Discourses &lt;/a &gt;founder Adam Rose, who provides us with a lot of nice literary context.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140449744/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140449744 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a7febf83f545059f267d2d4561533d6e" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the text &lt;/a &gt;or follow along in &lt;a href="http://www.aaronvandyke.net/summer_readings/Plato-phaedrus.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Summertime" by &lt;a href="http://www.newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New People &lt;/a &gt;, from &lt;em &gt;Might Get It Right &lt;/em &gt;(2013). &lt;a href="https://marklint.bandcamp.com/album/might-get-it-right" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to it free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plato picture by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 6/27/16.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

De Beauvoir is well known as a feminist and political leftist, and is concerned here with oppression. To fight an oppressor is necessarily to &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;will the oppressor's freedom, and de B. doesn't rule out violence, though she at the same time points out how inexcusable it is. That is, literally inexcusable, because there is no external moral standard ("I killed one to save many, which utilitarianism says is OK!") one can turn to for exculpation. And if you're &lt;em &gt;part &lt;/em &gt;of a corrupt system, you share in its responsibility, even if you are not personally guilty of exploiting someone.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So, what do you do? There's no rulebook to tell you, but in general terms, you need to respect the individual, whose value can never be simply written off as insignificant next to the group. And of course, people are exploited who claim to be satisfied with their lot, so paying attention to the individual is not simply getting their consent or doing what they say. You have to (when practically feasible) raise their consciousness and put them within grasp of their freedom, which only they can grasp.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan, and a Seth who was sick enough to drop off before the end of the discussion try to sort through de B's practical paradoxes. Check out Mark, Danny Lobell, and Beauvoir scholar &lt;a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/people/jennifer-hansen" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Hansen &lt;/a &gt;to discuss this and the previous episode on the &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/08/19/ep-140141-aftershow-on-simone-de-beauvoirs-ethics-of-ambiguity-feat-jennifer-hansen/" target="_blank"&gt;the Aftershow &lt;/a &gt;, which you can also choose to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OZhgshHSFB0" target="_blank"&gt;watch on YouTube &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Indiscretion (Mess Things Up)" from the 1993 &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;album &lt;em &gt;Spanish Armada: Songs of Love and Related Neuroses &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Simone De Beauvoir picture by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Simone De Beauvoir's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1480442801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1480442801 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=GZLC3H67BA6XLS6L" target="_blank"&gt;The Ethics of Ambiguity &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1947), parts I and II.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We return to existentialism! Instead of describing our predicament as "absurd," de Beauvoir prefers "ambiguous": We are a biological organism in the world, yet we're also free consciousness transcending the given situation. Truly coming to terms with this freedom means not only understanding that you transcend any label of character ("villain") or role ("doctor") that you or anyone else has put on you, but also recognizing that your freedom requires the freedom of others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;And this is the challenge of her book: In an existentialist world view that denies pre-existing moral laws, whether given by God or Reason or anything else, how can ethics be possible? Wouldn't it just be all subjective, or relative, if, as Nietzsche says, we are the ones who create values? What prevents an existentialist from being a self-consistent monster à la the antagonist of Cormac McCarthy's &lt;em &gt;No Country for Old Men &lt;/em &gt;?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The key is recognizing and preserving this human ambiguity. We are things in the world, yet qua consciousness, we're really a hole in the world, a little pit of desire, an unpredictable action behind a pair of eyes, and to embrace our negativity means recognizing not only that no external, alien moral law causes or commands our behavior, but also willing that being exist, i.e., the being of the things we desire, the projects we want to enact in the world, and the happiness of other people and improvement of the world. Self-consistently embracing our free nature therefore means willing the good, and this willing is an act of creation much like creation of an artwork.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan are all on board this time to fill out this picture and try to figure out whether de Beauvoir is right that not only does this existentialist picture support ethics, but in fact it's the &lt;em &gt;only &lt;/em &gt;way to support ethics: a pre-existent, objective standard would not allow us the freedom to actually choose the good. Think about how, for Plato, we never knowingly choose evil; we always want what we think is good but sometimes are just mistaken. De Beauvoir, like Augustine, thinks that we really can perversely choose to deny our nature, deny our freedom (though that denial remains a free choice), where pretending like Aristotle and (in a different way) most theologians that we have a built-in teleological "good" that by our nature we were meant to pursue is just another way of actually denying our total freedom.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Reasonably Lonely," by &lt;a href="http://www.marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &amp;amp; the Simulacra &lt;/a &gt;from &lt;em &gt;The Sinking and the Aftermath &lt;/em &gt;, recorded in 2000 and 2003, newly mixed.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;De Beauvoir picture by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We interview John about &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199385157/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199385157 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=OZSTKB6OADJWW36K" target="_blank"&gt;Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2015). What is perception? Searle says that it's not a matter of seeing a representation that is then somehow related to things in the real world. We see the actual objects, with no mediation. But then how can there be illusions?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Well, we see things under an aspect: a presentation of the thing. And that presentation presents itself as caused by just that thing that the perception is of. If these "conditions of satisfaction" (i.e., that the perception is actually caused by that thing) are not met, then we have a case of illusion: we thought we were perceiving that thing, but we really weren't. Simple! Right?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Searle lays out his theory for us and amusingly dismisses much of the history of philosophy in the first half, and then Mark, Wes, and Dylan continue the discussion to make sure we understood what was just said and chase down some threads of the conversation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Flesh and Blood" from The MayTricks'&lt;em &gt;Happy Songs Will Bring You Down &lt;/em &gt;(1994). &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/HappySongsAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Download the whole album for free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Searle picture by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 4/24/16.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Pierre Bourdieu's &lt;em &gt;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste &lt;/em &gt;(1979), introduction, chapter 1 through p. 63, conclusion, and postscript.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How do our tastes in music, art, and everything else reflect our social position? This philosophically trained sociologist administered a few detailed questionnaires in 1960s France and used the resulting differences in what people in different classes preferred and how they talked about these preferences to theorize about the role that taste plays in our social games. People with more education and/or with an upper-class social background use their ability to appreciate fine art (which requires some know-how to decode) to distinguish themselves: to prove that they deserve their social status. Other classes' tastes were in reaction to this dominant taste: middle-class responders aspired to have the taste of the elite (often getting it wrong by favoring simply pretentious works), while lower-class workers either made excuses for their lack of appreciation ("it's good but not not my cup of tea") or rebelled by reveling in low-class art. In all cases there was gamesmanship at work: the distinctions were at work in cementing or trying to move within or rebelling against the social order. (Seth posted the lists of classes as they were asked their opinions about a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PartiallyExLife/status/714638979795128320" target="_blank"&gt;high-brow &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PartiallyExLife/status/714639222590861313" target="_blank"&gt;middle &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PartiallyExLife/status/714639409954603008" target="_blank"&gt;low-brow &lt;/a &gt;work.) &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674212770/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674212770 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=QDT5HTJLCFEZDMTR" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Seth were joined by Tim Quirk, famed as singer from the '90s band &lt;a href="http://toomuchjoy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Too Much Joy &lt;/a &gt;and recent guest on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/03/11/nem8-tim-quirk/" target="_blank"&gt;Mark's Nakedly Examined Music podcast &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://tbquirk.com/?p=176" target="_blank"&gt;Here's that presentation &lt;/a &gt;, "Good News for Yo La Tengo," that he talks about.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "When She Took Off Her Shirt" from Tim's band Wonderlick's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AJQ7FG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002AJQ7FG &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=77OYMIRN6WWBZUFF" target="_blank"&gt;Topless At The Arco Arena &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2005).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Bourdieu picture by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer's "The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception" from &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804736332/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0804736332 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=KJ544JENZZYSLGAT" target="_blank"&gt;Dialectic of Enlightenment &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1944), plus Adorno's essay "&lt;a href="http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/adorno_culture_reconsidered.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Culture Industry Reconsidered &lt;/a &gt;" (1963).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does the entertainment industry affect us? Adorno and Horkheimer (who co-authored the book, but it looks like Adorno mainly wrote the essay we read) are founding figures of the Frankfurt school, which means using Marxism and the insights of psychoanalysis to diagnose the ills of society. According to Adorno, our "mass culture" is not from the masses at all. Not created by them certainly, but also not responding in capitalist fashion to their demands. Rather, it's imposed on us and brainwashes us into conformity. With stereotyped characters, by-the-numbers plotting, and an emphasis on style over substance, films entice and lull us into submission. Ditto for popular music and other media, each in their own insidious way. And it's not just a matter of high-brow art snobs worrying about low-brow material: The culture industry mixes the base and ethereal together (to the detriment of both) to catch everyone in its net; capitalism is happy to appropriate it all, so long as real thinking is discouraged!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The full foursome tangle with this quotable, laughable, overwrought text, finding many interesting observations about art even while finding the overall critique much too harsh and finicky.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "All Too Familiar," from around 1992 with all instruments by Mark Linsenmayer, released on &lt;em &gt;The MayTricks &lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/MayTricksAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Get the whole album free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Adorno picture by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 3/28/16.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;A whole second discussion on G.W.F. Hegel's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872200701/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0872200701 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=WR3M7UH7M5ECMERI" target="_blank"&gt;The Encyclopaedia Logic &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1817), hitting sections 78–99 on what the dialectic is and how it plays out in how the Concept of Being, when analyzed, shows itself to be identical to Nothingness, and how those in turn considered together "logically" lead to Becoming, which is the same as Determinate Being and also Quality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about Understanding vs. Reason: Kant thought that we can't do metaphysics because we can only talk sensibly about abstractions (via the Understanding) from our experience, and that Reason is the faculty by which we try to make sense of the big picture, and that Reason therefore tries to apply the categories of the Understanding beyond their proper province. Hegel thinks that right, Understanding only gives us abstractions, which are well and good, but don't tell us about metaphysics. When we use Reason to intuit Concepts, however, we're examining reality itself at a very high level, though Hegel doesn't want to call this "abstract," because when you examine these Concepts, they exhibit instabilities that propel them, so to speak, into other Concepts. Hegel is attempting to show us that progression.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You should probably listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50807546" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 134 &lt;/a &gt;before this one, but hopefully we're clearer this time around.

In short, our thoughts about fundamental metaphysical categories bear the same relations to each other as the the categories themselves do. This will take some explaining, so we're doing another two-discussion series here, this time just taking on the introductory part of his account. We talk a lot about how Hegel is reacting to and and building on Kant: how Kant said that due to the structure of the mind-world relation, we can't really know anything about the world and so can't do metaphysics at all. Hegel denies this, saying that we can reach "absolute knowledge" through rigorous thought, which is a matter of analyzing the internal contents of our various concepts and philosophical theories to see how they break down and so lead to improved versions of themselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This recording features Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Amogh Sahu of &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/symptomatic-redness/id954171474?mt=2" target="_blank"&gt;the Symptomatic Redness podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Examination of this book continues with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50807740"&gt;ep.135 &lt;/a &gt;and concludes with the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50807881"&gt;Aftershow &lt;/a &gt;featuring Chris Yeomans.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Procrastination" by Steve Petrinko from The MayTricks'&lt;em &gt;Happy Songs Will Bring You Down &lt;/em &gt;(1994). &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/HappySongsAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Download the whole album for free &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/02/27/nem6-steve-petrinko/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to Mark interview Steve &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;a href="http://www.nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hegel picture by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 2/28/16.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Fromm's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1nRWJmr" target="_blank"&gt;The Art of Loving &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1956).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A Valentine's Day special topic! What is love, really? This psychoanalyst of the Frankfurt school thinks that real love is not something one "falls" into, but is an art, an activity, and doing it well requires a disciplined openness and psychological health. Love is the answer to the deep human need to rid ourselves of isolation, but a mere sexual union won't provide real intimacy. To connect the center of your being with the center of another's being, you need to really know yourself and know the other, and this knowing requires an overall openness that amounts to a love of humanity, a feeling of oneness with nature, and an overall orientation toward the good, which is what he considers a mature take on "love of God," which doesn't imply, e.g., a belief in a judging deity, which would be a mature imposition into nature of insecurities about the conditional love of one's father.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So yes, this is replete with psychoanalytic weirdness (and without any clinical basis presented), and very much reflects its time (prurient, sexist, homophobic), but Fromm also puts forward a Marxist social commentary that's very much in line with our New Work and Hannah Arendt episodes, i.e., we need to remake society into the kind of place where loving can be the rule and not the exception, as our current society steers us to treat others and ourselves like commodities to be used, and romantic love as likewise trying to score the best deal, find the best love object and make yourself the most desirable (attractive, successful), none of which adds up to intimacy. Oh, and also, stop watching so much TV!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This recording features the core four: Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061129739/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061129739 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=L7RB3AXQTFH2K3U4" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://farzad.devbro.com/the%20art%20of%20loving.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online copy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End songs: "Kimmy" (recorded 1995), from &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;Black Jelly Beans &amp;amp; Smokes &lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/BlackJellyBeans.html" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the album free &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on April 16 after our Neil Postman discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start by talking about discussion options on our sites (&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/04/04/nightcap-early-april-2021/#comment-3118428" target="_blank"&gt;read Jason's post that prompted this &lt;/a &gt;). Discord will be coming for all Citizens (when we get to it)!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then reflect on (half of us) having read Avicenna and whether we're ever going to finish even a minimal treatment of the Middle Ages (we will!). Should we read something else (something better than Postman) in the further history of writing about communications? Wes recommends &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465076165/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465076165 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=9ad957f63fefd27e16616f694eb67a7e" target="_blank"&gt;Seductions Of Crime: Moral And Sensual Attractions In Doing Evil &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;among many other things that are probably not what Mark had in mind in bringing it up.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We'll be doing some more German idealism (Fichte) for episode 271; should we do second-string guys like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._C._S._Schiller" target="_blank"&gt;F.C.S. Schiller &lt;/a &gt;? Formal logic?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We contemplate a possible eventual end to the podcast. No such end is planned. How many other podcasts last twelve years?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, some reflections on how personal/boring Nightcaps might be. How many motorcycles do we have? Wes recommends &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cum-town/id1113585468" target="_blank"&gt;Cum Town &lt;/a &gt;as our Nightcap model.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/04/25/ep268-1-postman-amusing-ourselves-to-death-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business &lt;/em &gt;with guest Brian Hirt.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Let's get critical: Is it really the case that the written word is so much more suited for providing context than television, which after all does retain some of the virtues of the pre-literate speechifying culture that Socrates preferred over writing? Perhaps TV is to speech as the Internet is to writing: The first of each pair uses the intake technology of the second (i.e. hearing/seeing and then reading), but yet this first includes technical features that discourage contextualization: the ease of changing the channel or clicking away as compared to walking away or throwing down the book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Or rather (since all four of these actions are either), if you do put down the book at least, there it is again in the same spot so long as you've used a bookmark. And now of course recorded or asynchronously streaming TV offers that same place-holding capacity, so a streaming documentary series can retain the same context as a book on the same subject. Yes, the book can include more informational detail, like footnotes, and is more easily skimmable. These make it perhaps more useful as a reference work, but which medium is better for retaining information in memory: the one that shows the subject in vivid detail with sound, or that uses the reader's imagination to work out the specifics? I'm not sure.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We debate whether some of our favorite books could be made into good films and consider Postman's "&lt;a href="https://jacklule.medium.com/on-reading-amusing-ourselves-to-death-chapter-10-84b3101c4633" target="_blank"&gt;commandments of TV &lt;/a &gt;":&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thou shalt have no prerequisites &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thou shalt induce on perplexity &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thou shalt avoid exposition like the ten plagues visited upon Egypt &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;The latter portion of this discussion recounts Postman's claims about how these commandments damage various aspects of our culture: education, politics, news, and religion. Is TV as bad for these institutions as Postman says, or are there advantages to, for instance, watching a televised (Zoom?) course over attending a large lecture in person?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business &lt;/em &gt;(1985), featuring Mark, Seth, Dylan, Wes, and guest Brian Hirt, the co-host of &lt;a href="https://prettymuchpop.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Pretty Much Pop &lt;/a &gt;with degrees in linguistics and science education.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does the form in which we receive media affect how we think? Postman tweaks Marshall McLuhan's famous slogan "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message" target="_blank"&gt;the medium is the message &lt;/a &gt;" to say "the medium is the metaphor." This means that how we experience information gives us an image of how the world is. If we primarily interact with the world by talking to people face to face, then the world seems very small, and the kinds of things that are important are those that are amenable to being expressed that way. Aristotle's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/07/06/ep247-aristotle-rhetoric-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Rhetoric &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;concerns the forms of arguments that are likely to convince a crowd, and Plato in the &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/06/27/ep142-1-plato-phaedrus/" target="_blank"&gt;Phaedrus &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;was concerned that the advent of writing would ruin authentic communication and cause people to let their memorization skills deteriorate.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;With writing, and moreso with the advent of the printing press, on Postman's account people's attention spans got longer, and they were used to being able to follow lengthy chains of reasoning. Descartes reminded us in his &lt;em &gt;Rules for Direction of the Mind &lt;/em &gt;that this understanding can be illusory: that we only really understand a lengthy chain if we can hold each link of it in turn in our minds and see clearly how they all fit together. Still, the metaphor that writing conveys is that the world is a reasonable place, that its truths can be conveyed impersonally via something objective like a book, and that to apprehend these truths, we have to stop and study. Also, due to the effort it takes to print a book, the presumption is that the written word is authoritative; this is not just some random joe writing on the Internet.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;With the advent of the telegraph, it's as if the vast distances of the world shrink. Because its messages are so short, they're devoid of context. When they're reported as "news," there's probably very little in the way of useful actions we can take on receiving them. A newspaper then becomes a disposable collection of out-of-context, useless bits of information, and yet this is something that serious people are supposed to read and take seriously.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When television is invented, things get worse: Television (like radio) also presents information without context, as we need to be able to understand at any time we may turn it on. But television adds images, and the commercial forces that require that people keep watching mean that these images must be as attractive as possible and that the image and sound experience must be as entertaining as possible. While advertising in early newspapers was aimed at providing information about available services, it becomes empty sloganeering, and politics follows suit, becoming reduced to sound bites. TV news lurches from one disconnected fact to another with the same cheery demeanor reducing everything to meaninglessness. Everything shifts to a narrative and/or musical presentation to be more entertaining; we expect an quick emotional hook and get bored by anything else.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Postman claimed that this has had terrible effects on our attention spans, our ability to reason and make sound decisions, to understand (or even feel) anything requiring depth, and to learn. As primarily an educator and theorist about education, he thought that while, &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/08/03/ep249-dewey-education-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;per Dewey &lt;/a &gt;, yes, of course we learn better when we have some practical engagement with a subject and aren't just being handed dry subject matter, but TV's prevalence in the culture has created the expectation that learning must be entertainment. Like Allan Boom, Postman complained about students today being ruined by modern culture, unequipped for the reflective engagement that a liberal education requires. TV is (using McLuhan's term) a "hot" medium: It fills our senses, giving its passive spectators no chance to interact or even stop to think (at least not with complexity beyond &lt;em &gt;Dora the Explorer &lt;/em &gt;). If TV provides us with a metaphor (or a "myth" per Barthes) for the way we expect the world to work, then we become passive spectators in our lives, ripe for fascism and other nasty things. Postman claimed that this is the blueprint for dystopia a la &lt;em &gt;Brave New World &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This can be considered another entry in our ongoing &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/tag/social-construction/" target="_blank"&gt;social construction series &lt;/a &gt;, providing a concrete example of a way in which our social environment, and hence our minds, are allegedly constructed. (For a more concrete version of this hypothesis in linguistics, Brian mentions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/sapir-whorf-hypothesis" target="_blank"&gt;the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis &lt;/a &gt;.) What is Postman's solution? Not giving up TV; it's too late for that. The best we can do is, through education, foreground this process of construction so that we are not unwitting victims of it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ek4bD9" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://ektr.uni-eger.hu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/neil-postman-amusing-ourselves-to-death-public-discourse-in-the-age-of-show-business.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try an online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Since the book is from 1985, an obvious question is how the Internet fares as an advance over TV. Yes, it's more interactive, and you &lt;em &gt;can &lt;/em &gt;easily get context by digging deeper with more searching into a topic. However, it's also geared even moreso to shorter attention spans and context-free information delivery, and given the ease of posting, the information we're exposed to (especially on social media) can be of much lower quality than we'd get from books or even curated TV news. A prominent writer in this area is &lt;a href="http://www.nicholascarr.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nicholas Carr &lt;/a &gt;, and we looked at a widely read article he wrote for the Atlantic in 2008 called "&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/" target="_blank"&gt;Is Google Making Us Stupid &lt;/a &gt;."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On selected "moral epistles" (from around 65 CE) by Lucius Annaeus Seneca: 4. On the Terrors of Death, 12. On Old Age, 49. On the Shortness of Life, 59. On Pleasure and Joy, 62. On Good Company, 92. On the Happy Life, 96. On Facing Hardship, and 116. On Self Control. We're joined by &lt;a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Philosophy/Faculty-Bios/Massimo-Pigliucci" target="_blank"&gt;Massimo Pigliucci &lt;/a &gt;of the &lt;a href="https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/massimo-on-stoicism/" target="_blank"&gt;How to Be a Stoic blog &lt;/a &gt;, who for a long time was on the &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Rationally Speaking &lt;/a &gt;podcast.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Back in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-124-stoic-50432763" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 124 &lt;/a &gt;we considered the Stoic Epictetus, but due to audience demand, we wanted a second and a third opinion: Seneca, unlike Epictetus, explicitly advocated a public life, and seemed to have less problem with deep friendships and other sorts of attachments, so long as these things are kept in perspective. Unfortunately, Seneca is very light on actual justifications for this perspective, and apparently sees knowing the ultimate truths of existence as a fairly simple matter, the trick being to really internalize these truths and let them guide your actions, especially when tragedy strikes. Life is a battle, says Seneca, and it's really better for us that it is, as a life without challenge would be a life without meaning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Massimo, along with Tad Brennan's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T44A88/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002T44A88 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=TNJUWS2UBIYRF5C6" target="_blank"&gt;The Stoic Life: Emotions, Duties, and Fate &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2007), provided a reality check for all of this, helping us to interpret the text charitably and see how ancient Stoic writings are integrated into modern practice. The key is that the only thing ultimately important is your own virtue, which is all you have control over. Other things can and should be "preferred," but aren't granted the status of moral goods. When you work hard toward a goal, it's not the goal that's good, but the working itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Massimo and Dylan read from this new translation: &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/022626517X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=022626517X &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=PKOY3UEG4FEEAGKT" target="_blank"&gt;Letters on Ethics: To Lucilius (The Complete Works of Lucius Annaeus Seneca)&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, while Mark and Wes read this electronic version: &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JFDMIMQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00JFDMIMQ &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=XRUFFKNSZUNLIKRV" target="_blank"&gt;Delphi Complete Works of Seneca the Younger &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, though during the recording we were reading some of these from &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199533210/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199533210 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=CK7UBIAXPF43ZXJL" target="_blank"&gt;Selected Letters (Oxford World's Classics)&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which you can read &lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/Seneca/Seneca_djvu.txt" target="_blank"&gt;on the web &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "I Lose Control" by The MayTricks from &lt;em &gt;So Chewy!&lt;/em &gt;(1993), which you can &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/SoChewyAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;listen to in full &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our second discussion of &lt;em &gt;De Anima &lt;/em &gt;or &lt;em &gt;On the Soul &lt;/em &gt;(350 BCE), this time on book 3.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the intellect? In &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/12/27/ep130-aristotle-biology-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 130 &lt;/a &gt;, we talked about Aristotle's idea of the soul as the form of the body and about two of its functions or parts: the nutritive and the sensitive. Here we talk more about how sensation is supposed to work, according to Aristotle, and how the sense organs interact with each other. Aristotle doesn't think, like &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/05/14/ep19-kant-citizens/" target="_blank"&gt;Kant &lt;/a &gt;, that the mind synthesizes data from the senses to create objects. Rather, that synthesis already happens just at the level of sense, that we perceive whole objects and not points in space. We talk about how this then relates to the faculty of imagination, and finally, the intellect (&lt;em &gt;nous &lt;/em &gt;, in Greek), which Aristotle calls the "form of forms." It's literally nothing (just pure potential) until it thinks of something, at which point it takes on the form of the thing thought of. And when it's thinking of highfalutin metaphysical concepts, it's not even MY mind or YOUR mind: it's just the universal mind itself thinking, identical to the contents of its thought. Yes, this is weird.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We recommend that you check out the text: Here's &lt;a href="http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sp344/0198240848%20-%20De%20Anima%20Books%20II%20and%20III%20(With%20Passages%20From%20Book%20I)%20-%20Aristotle,%20Christopher%20Shields,%20D.%20W.%20Hamlyn.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;an online translation &lt;/a &gt;by D.W.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;De Anima &lt;/em &gt;or &lt;em &gt;On the Soul &lt;/em &gt;(350 BCE), books 1 and 2. We lead off with listener mail; Aristotle starts 17 minutes in.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What can this ancient text tell us about biological life? Much of the interest and difficulty here is the very different conceptual schemes at play: What counts as a scientific explanation? Aristotle gives a highly general account about what, for all living things, makes them alive. He describes life as "the first actuality of a natural body which has organs," meaning that bodies (our bodies, plant bodies, animal bodies) truly express their nature only when they're growing and reproducing and all that stuff that bodies do. The body itself is potential, and life is its actuality. So what the heck kind of explanation is that, and how does it tie into all that metaphysical stuff you may have heard about Aristotle concerning forms and different types of causation and substances?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth returns to complete the formal foursome as we slowly penetrate this difficult text. With this one more than others, you'd be well advised to follow along in the text. &lt;a href="http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sp344/0198240848%20-%20De%20Anima%20Books%20II%20and%20III%20(With%20Passages%20From%20Book%20I)%20-%20Aristotle,%20Christopher%20Shields,%20D.%20W.%20Hamlyn.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;This online translation &lt;/a &gt;by D.W. Hamlyn should do the trick. The &lt;a href="http://www.focusing.org/aristotle/" target="_blank"&gt;line-by-line commentary that Seth refers to &lt;/a &gt;is by Eugene T. Gendlin.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/01/11/ep131-1aristotle-mind/" target="_blank"&gt;Episode 131 &lt;/a &gt;will continue our exploration of this book, focusing on book 3, where Aristotle presents what's often been described as the first work in the philosophy of mind: He'll focus there on the intellect, on how the mind can know things, on whether the intellect is separable from the body.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Intermission Song" from the 1993 &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;album &lt;em &gt;Spanish Armada: Songs of Love and Related Neuroses &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle picture by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 12/27/15 &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Clearly, there are smart, thoughtful people on both sides of the issue, but why should that be, if one could glean correct opinions about religious matters from our shared experience of the world? Or if the evidence is insufficient either way, aren't there still some standards of reasonableness we can appeal to for what the wisest course of action to take is when we don't have sufficient evidence?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Antony Flew compares the situation to a court of law, where we presume innocence; likewise, we should presume atheism. Alvin Plantinga argues instead that belief in God is properly basic, like belief in other minds or in the external world. Basil Mitchell gives us an analysis of how knowledge of big, general matters (religious and otherwise) actually works, pointing out that a rigorous demand for evidence across the board would leave us with no significant beliefs of any sort (just ask Descartes!).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "The Meaning of Meaning" (1975).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So if per Kripke, meaning is NOT a matter of having a description in your head, then what is it? Hilary Putnam reformulates Kripke's insight in terms of Twin Earths: If Earth-water is H2O, and on Twin Earth, they have something that looks just like water but is a different compound, then we wouldn't call that water, right? Putnam says part of what makes up the meaning of a word is an implicit pointing to the stuff around us, so it's relative to the speaker: The Twin Earthers saying "water" are referring to the stuff around them, not H2O. So even though we and the Twin Earthers both have the same mental contents, our reference points at different stuff.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Since meaning is in this sense outside the head, how do we even know if someone knows what a word means? Putnam says that we have the "stereotype" of that word in mind, which is like a description, but isn't the thing that picks out the referent, e.g., my stereotype of "elm" may (if I don't know a lot about trees) be the SAME stereotype as "beech," yet that's enough for me to be counted by other English speakers as understanding these two words. What makes "elm" refer to the kind of tree it does is not my picture of it (I don't really have one!) but what the experts say about it: Putnam calls this a semantic division of labor.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan are rejoined by &lt;a href="http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/podcasts/elucidations.html" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Teichman &lt;/a &gt;for this gripping discussion, which in addition to covering that main essay also touched on Putnam's articles "It Ain't Necessarily So" (1962) and "Is Semantics Possible" (1970). &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/11/23/topic128-putnam/" target="_blank"&gt;Learn more about the topic and get the readings &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "In the Boatyard" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/madisonlint.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &amp;amp; the Madison Lint Ensemble &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Experience and Nature &lt;/em &gt;(1925), through ch. 4.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the relationship between our experience and the world that science investigates? Dewey thinks that these are one and the same, and philosophies that call some part of it (like atoms or Platonic forms) the real part while the experienced world is a distortion are unjustified. We need to remove the unjustified split between perception and reality to give humanistic phenomena (like ethics) their due and to keep our philosophical sentiments fully aware of their origins in human strivings, lest we fall prey to prejudice and wishful thinking, like, say Augustine, who was so afraid of the suffering attendant to impermanence that he denied the true reality of any impermanence or evil.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan talk about whether this sort of Nietzschean examination of philosophical motives holds water, whether an experienced quality like "scariness" can really be "out in the world" (instead of just in our minds), the relationship between the objects of experience and the objects of science, what role "ends" should play in science, where aesthetic feeling comes into the picture (everywhere!), and more. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/11/13/topic127-dewey/" target="_blank"&gt;Learn more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Uncontrollable Fear" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/maytrick.html" target="_blank"&gt;The MayTricks &lt;/a &gt;from &lt;em &gt;So Chewy!&lt;/em &gt;(1993), written/sung by Steve Petrinko. &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/SoChewyAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Get the album free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dewey image by Sterling Bartlett.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 11/15/15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Naming and Necessity &lt;/em &gt;(1980).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the relationship between language and the world? Specifically, what makes a name or a class term (like "tiger") pick out the person or things that it does? Saul Kripke wanted to correct the dominant view of his time (which involved speakers having some description in mind, and it's that description that hooks the word to the thing), and used modal language to do it: He talked about other possible worlds (other ways our world could have turned out, not literal other dimensions or something).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;His account had implications for metaphysics and science, in that he claimed that if we find a scientific truth like "heat is the motion of molecules," then this would be true in all possible worlds. We might think that we could have discovered that heat was something else, but really, if we imagine a world in which that happened, what those scientists would have been looking at was actually not heat at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Confused yet? Mark, Wes, Dylan, and returning guest &lt;a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~teichman/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Teichman &lt;/a &gt;get deep into the thickets on this one, our first foray in a while into analytic philosophy. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/10/20/topic-for-126-saul-kripke-on-possibilities-language-and-science/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about it and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Oh, and &lt;a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v02/n17/richard-rorty/kripke-versus-kant" target="_blank"&gt;here's &lt;/a &gt;that essay about Kripke by Richard Rorty that we discuss briefly near the end.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Reason Enough" by &lt;a href="http://www.marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;, a brand-new recording of a song written in 2003.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 10/31/15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Human Condition &lt;/em &gt;(1958), Prologue and Sections 1 and 2.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How has our distinction between the private and public evolved over time? Arendt uses this history, and chiefly the differences between our time and ancient Athens, to launch a critique of modern society. In thinking about public, practical necessities like the economy, we've lost sight of the distinction between labor (what we need to do to sustain ourselves), work (the creation of things that will last longer than our lifespan), and political action (which needs to involve a real dialogue among equals, not the rote party posturing driven by economic interests that we have now).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We've become a society of laborers, defining ourselves in terms of our jobs and looking at politics as chiefly tasked with economic administration, which is kind of like national housekeeping. "The social" has erased the distinction between public and private realms, crushing us with its demands for conformity and leaving the private realm as merely "the intimate." We need both robust political engagement and a space for deep, private contemplation in order to live fully and avoid catastrophic political blunders (e.g., creating technologies that will destroy us).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The fab four conducted this podcast &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/pel-live/" target="_blank"&gt;live at the Pittsburgh Continental Philosophy Conference &lt;/a &gt;, and the discussion is followed by an audience participation portion that involved conference participants including headliner &lt;a href="http://www.duq.edu/academics/faculty/fred-evans" target="_blank"&gt;Fred Evans &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is it like to do philosophy in public? As prelude to our appearance at the Pittsburgh Continental Philosophy Network Conference on theory and public space, Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan sat down for questions by moderator Erica Freeman, conference host Justin Pearl, conference presenters Jeremy Northup and Jonathan Wurtz, Not School luminary Marilyn Lawrence, our editor and sound guy Aaron Watson, and other attendees.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How do we pick our topics? What does academia think of us (so far as we can tell)? How do we apply philosophy to our daily lives? What's the future of philosophy (or rather, how do we wildly speculate when asked such a question)? When we philosophize for pennies on street corners, do the police make us stop? Only by listening will your training be complete.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the &lt;em &gt;Manual of Epictetus &lt;/em &gt;, aka &lt;em &gt;The Enchiridion &lt;/em &gt;, from around 135 CE.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's a wise strategy for life? What is freedom? Stoicism says that the secret is mastering yourself. If you let yourself be perturbed by things that happen to you, then you're a slave to those external things. Your good lies only in the things you can (with practice) control, i.e., your own attitudes, judgments, and opinions. Even a slave can be free, according to this strategy: Nothing external can break your spirit unless you let it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The full four are joined by comedian Alex Fossella of the &lt;a href="http://moderndayphilosophers.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Modern Day Philosophers podcast &lt;/a &gt;to argue about how weird and misguided Epictetus's advice actually is. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/09/19/topic124-stoicism-epictetus/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "But I Won't" by &lt;a href="http://www.marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;from &lt;em &gt;Spanish Armada: Songs of Love and Related Neuroses &lt;/em &gt;(1993).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Epictetus image by Sterling Bartlett.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 9/19/15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On F.A. Hayek's "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945) and Amartya Sen's &lt;em &gt;On Ethics and Economics &lt;/em &gt;(1987).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is economics a pseudoscience? Certainly, trying to model a phenomenon mathematically and so predict, for example, the consequences of proposed legislation, is better than acting blindly, but given the complexity of the system, are the simplifications required to create a model just too immense?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hayek argues that the whole idea of sitting back and contemplating how to plan an optimal economy is misconceived, because the planners are not in a position to know all the relevant details about supply and demand. Instead, this information is spread among many people, and the price system communicates what people actually need to know to make local economic decisions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Amartya Sen discusses the many simplifying assumptions of economics, such as the claim that individuals are rational welfare-maximizers, and that "welfare," (i.e., "the good") is equivalent to pursuing one's desires or maximizing one's material gain.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth, Wes, and Mark are joined by economics guy &lt;a href="http://ide.mit.edu/about-us/people/seth-benzell" target="_blank"&gt;Seth Benzell &lt;/a &gt;to try to figure out to what extent the two readings actually disagree, what the political upshot is, and whether philosophers can simply wander into the domain of this supposed science and say anything worth hearing. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/08/19/topic123-hayek-sen-economics/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more information and get the texts &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/09/05/precognition-of-ep-123-economics-f-a-hayek-and-amartya-sen/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to Seth B.'s introduction to the readings &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "People Who Throw Away Love" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;, recorded 1997, remixed now.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hayek picture by Sterling Bartlett.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 9/5/15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Host Danny Lobell and Wes Alwan reflected on our recent discussions on Augustine's &lt;em &gt;Confessions &lt;/em &gt;, with an actual Augustine scholar, &lt;a href="https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/artsci/philosophy/people/facstaff.html?mail=james.wetzel@villanova.edu &amp;amp;xsl=bio_long" target="_blank"&gt;James Wetzel &lt;/a &gt;of Villanova University, author of such books as &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521064813/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0521064813 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=KJXBVV3EKYTUYZQJ" target="_blank"&gt;Augustine and the Limits of Virtue &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2008), &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847061966/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1847061966 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=TMLIACPWVTIEG6X4" target="_blank"&gt;Augustine: A Guide for the Perplexed &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2010), and &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608999459/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1608999459 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=ES7QEPL25OGGEUTB" target="_blank"&gt;Parting Knowledge: Essays after Augustine &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2013). Also on the call are PEL listeners Terra Leigh Bell, Amogh Sahu, and Scott Anderson.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What does it mean to act for the sake of God in Augustine's sense? What is Augustine really trying to do? What's his place in history? Jim says his philosophy is "a Romanized form of Stoicism." The discussion covers humility, love, desire, grief, sex, misogyny, degrees of reality, and how love of God fits in with relating to other people, given that all views of God are "necessarily fictional." &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This was recorded today (9/6/15), and posted with minimal editing. Let us know if you want us to do more of these, or if enough Augustine is enough!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;A second discussion on &lt;em &gt;The Confessions &lt;/em &gt;(400 CE), this time on books 10–13.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is memory and how does it relate to time and being? Augustine thinks that memory is a storehouse, but it contains not just the sensations we put in it, but also (à la &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/04/20/ep18-plato-citizens/" target="_blank"&gt;Plato's theory of recollection &lt;/a &gt;) really all legitimate knowledge. It's our route to God, to real Being. Memory also solves the problem of time: What is time, when God (i.e., reality) is timeless, and when the past and future don't (right now) exist? Time is really just our memory and expectations, imposed on the present moment. Mark, Wes, and Dylan also discuss language, knowledge, hermeneutics, creation, and of course, more on will and Augustine's peculiar and rigorous moral demands.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This continues &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50298372" target="_blank"&gt;our previous discussion &lt;/a &gt;on the earlier parts of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/08/05/topic-122-123-augustine/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Confessions &lt;/em &gt;(400 CE), books 1–9.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The question is not "What is virtue?" because knowing what virtue is isn't enough. The problem, for Aurelius Augustinus, aka St. Augustine of Hippo, is doing what you know to be right. However, we shouldn't expect our capacity to know to be operating well unless we're already oriented correctly, which for Augustine means toward God. Yes, God created all this stuff, and qua creation it is Good, but getting too wrapped up in worldly things is misguided for one, because those things don't last; and foolish, because they don't provide true satisfaction anyway (which would have to be eternal); and corrupting, because it rips your will in two, creating exactly this division between what you want to do and what you know you should do.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan fight between interest in Augustine's puzzles and overload at his self-loathing and constant, quotation-packed praying. Seth loses the fight.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/08/05/topic-122-123-augustine/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "I Still Want" by &lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New People &lt;/a &gt;, from &lt;em &gt;Impossible Things &lt;/em &gt;(2011).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Featuring Mark Linsenmayer, Michael Burgess, Tara Leigh Bell, John Ludders, Chris Eyre, Benjamin Feddersen. Recorded April 26, 2015, 1 hr., 50 min.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The conversation had three parts, covering the following questions:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;1. Does Sheehan represent a legitimate academic consensus? His story is pretty damning re. the historical accuracy of the traditional Jesus story, and he claims the historical research is independent of faith, such that the outlines of his story are agreed to by the conservative and the liberal alike, yet certainly no official church is going to want to admit that the Resurrection is a demonstrable fiction.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;2. What are the outlines of his story about the evolution of these stories by faith communities? He presents the historical-critical method and explains how scholars have concluded that the earliest documents were sayings documents, i.e. as with Confucius or Buddha, what we primarily have are oral traditions (eventually written down) about things Jesus taught, e.g. the Parables. Then the author of the book of Mark constructed (i.e. invented) the first narrative of Jesus's life, which was then taken up by the authors of Luke and Matthew, who added common mythical elements like the fantastic story of his birth, and all the dramatics around his death, and John with the really "high Christology" stuff was even later than that.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;3. Should this denial of the historical accuracy of the traditional story imply a loss of faith? Sheehan and others claim that the Biblical writers themselves didn't have historical accuracy in mind, that it's only with the Enlightenment that we get this ideal of scientific objectivity that religion has (wrongly) claimed as its own standard as well, which can only lead to horrific scholarship and bullheadedness in the face of contrary evidence. Per Ricoeur, we should instead read the Bible as myth, which is a good thing: as inspiring metaphor for the human condition and direct incitement to live spiritually and act ethically.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Seth covers is kale shard with a side of cigar.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Then a question from Seth for the group: How do our work/social lives and our not-so-secret podcast lives interact? When acquaintances ask us about the podcast, how much do we try to get them to listen to it? Do we expect "normies" (not a word we use) to actually like PEL?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Then a political issue: Is it our responsibility to cover historical women philosophers just on the grounds of their being women? Wes has a lot to say about this. &lt;a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/how-women-have-shaped-philosophy-nine-female-philosophers-our-authors-admire/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's that article that prompted this &lt;/a &gt;. Seth wants to relate to Arendt over her Judaism; Wes objects to relating to anyone on "nationalist" grounds (see &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/03/12/ep160-orwell-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our Orwell episode &lt;/a &gt;). Mark cites arguments that yes, of course we want to read works by women and minorities to get those perspectives on philosophical issues. Wes denies that there is any substantial commonality among the perspectives within such groups, and that the appeal of a great writer of whatever stripe is never essentially a matter of their group identity, and therefore to choose authors based on their identity instead of their idiosyncratic genius is a mistake. And since most of the pre-20th-century geniuses that we ever hear about are white men, that explains why we have focused on them, and none of the current trends have enough motivating force to change our topic selection processes in this respect. However, we're all in agreement that if there are unheralded geniuses that are worth our time, we're all for hearing about and possibly covering them, so the practical upshot of this disagreement may be negligible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on Avicenna's argument for the existence of God and on the "flying man" argument for the soul's immateriality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start by drilling more into Avicenna's metaphysical picture via his concept of necessity, and how we know that the mind is necessarily (essentially, according to its nature a.k.a. quiddity) different than the body. When you know something's essence, you know what would be required for it to exist. The flying man knows that his essence has existence, but is not aware of his body, so he knows that this essence does not include the body; the body is not required for that essence to be instantiated (i.e. to exist). But does self-awareness really amount to knowing that your essence at all? Yes, for Avicenna: What a self really amounts to is a self-aware soul.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk more about self-consciousness and how this relates to the teleological part of our nature: For Avicenna (as for Aristotle), our nature as rational animal means that our unique essence is to be able to think better, and better here (as for Plato) means to be pointed toward God. To not do philosophy is to live as an animal. Also, we look at Avicenna as a rationalist: If you're sharp enough, you should be able to figure out all these fundamental truths about God and the self without being taught them, and that's not because we recollect them a la Plato, but because we can derive all of philosophy from analysis of our experience, just as in the case of the flying man.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about "mental existence" and how this might apply to infinity. Avicenna (like Aristotle) believed that the universe was eternal, so there can be an infinite chain of causality going back in time, but there can't be an actual infinity of causes existing at one instant, just like (per &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes" target="_blank"&gt;Zeno's paradox &lt;/a &gt;) there aren't an actually infinite number of points on a line, even though one could keep dividing that line indefinitely.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We wrap up by considering how God's properties are supposedly derivable from his basic essence as the one necessary being and the cause of the universe. For instance, God must be "simple" because if He had parts he would depend upon those parts. He's also "unique" because if there were two necessary existents, then there would be some property that would differentiate them, and that property would be a &lt;em &gt;cause &lt;/em &gt;(a condition) of those necessary existents, but we've already said that the necessary existent has no cause, i.e. doesn't depend on anything else. Most of these end up being negative descriptions (see our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/09/01/ep101-maimonides-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Maimonides episode &lt;/a &gt;for more "negative theology"), i.e. descriptions of things that God can't be or can't have due to His having no determining qualities that would make Him into a multiplicity or something that is caused in any way by that quality. For instance is God "perfect"? Well, yes, in that He lacks any imperfection, but no in that He doesn't have that property "perfection"; strictly speaking He transcends perfection.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The later philosopher Peter refers to is &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mulla-sadra/" target="_blank"&gt;Mulla Sadra &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On selections and commentary about Avicenna's argument from around 1020 C.E. for the existence of God (including arguments to prove that God has the person-like properties that Islam imputes to him) and his "flying man" argument for the soul's essential independence from matter. Featuring Mark, Dylan, and our guest Peter Adamson from the &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/" target="_blank"&gt;History of Philosophy podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Avicenna (aka Ibn Sina) historically provided an essential link between Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, and his influence not only shows up in European "modern" philosophy about God (like Descartes), but is even stronger in the Middle East. He wrote his own version of the Aristotelian corpus that had been passed down to him, first in &lt;em &gt;The Book of Healing &lt;/em &gt;(aka &lt;em &gt;Shifa &lt;/em &gt;or &lt;em &gt;The Cure &lt;/em &gt;), then more briefly in &lt;em &gt;The Book of Deliverance &lt;/em &gt;(&lt;em &gt;Najat &lt;/em &gt;or &lt;em &gt;The Salvation &lt;/em &gt;), and then with extreme conciseness in &lt;em &gt;Pointers and Reminders &lt;/em &gt;(&lt;em &gt;Isharat &lt;/em &gt;or &lt;em &gt;Remarks and Admonitions &lt;/em &gt;). Our sources pulled from all three of these readings and more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The argument for the existence of God is one of those considered later by Aquinas as "the argument from contingency," and asks the question "why is there something rather than nothing?" We have a strong intuition, says this argument, that anything we experience must have a reason for its existence, must have something that it relies on for its existence. In other words, everything we experience is contingent. The issue is not (as with the cosmological argument) causality over time: We're not asking what temporally prior thing caused the thing we're contemplating, but what right now accounts for the thing. So yes a house in a familiar sense was caused by its builder, but more immediately, its cause is the materials that make it up, arranged in the way they are. And what causes in this sense a piece of wood making up the house to provide the support it does? Its makeup: molecules in a particular type of configuration. And so the chain goes on. If each of the links of this chain is contingent, relying as it does on something else (in other words, if that cause hadn't occurred, neither would the contingent thing; its existence is contingent on the existence of its cause), could it be that the whole chain is contingent? Could it too have an underlying supportive cause? Avicenna says no: Then that cause would just be part of the whole chain of contingency. The whole chain needs to have some stopping point, or else none of it would exist, and that's the necessary being.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So even though we've never experienced anything like this necessary being, reason itself tells us that such a being must exist, based on our experience of contingency in the world. One of our sources (a 2001 article by Toby Mayer) says that the argument combines this initial experiential component (like the cosmological argument) with a definitional, a priori element (like the ontological argument). It's a sound argument so long as you accept that initial metaphysical intuition that everything we experience is contingent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Even if this argument works to establish the existence of a necessary being, why would we think that this is God? Avicenna uses the two properties he's proven (i.e. that it's necessary, and that it causes all the other beings) to derive God's other properties. With this picture of instantaneous causality that we've described, God ends up being the immediate cause of everything else: this is his omnipotence. This picture is unlike Plato's &lt;em &gt;Timaeus &lt;/em &gt;where there was some non-God substance (the chora or receptacle) that is the raw material that God uses to build the world. Instead, the world emanates directly from God's nature.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A comparison and contrast with Leibniz may be useful here: Leibniz's &lt;em &gt;Theodicy &lt;/em &gt;gives us a picture of a God who scans all possible worlds and is compelled by the necessity of His good nature to create the optimal one. So in a sense, God makes a choice, but because He couldn't have made any other choice, this is really no choice at all. For Avicenna, God likewise makes the best possible world for us, but the process does not require scanning other possibilities. In fact, Avicenna's metaphysics entails that everything that is possible actually does happen. Why? Because possible is just another word for contingent. Considered in itself, the computer in front of me might or might not have been there. Its existence is contingent on many circumstances and compositional factors. But if we then keep going back down the causal chain, we get to the necessary being, whose existence is sufficient to necessitate all the other links in the chain. So really, despite appearances, everything we perceive is really necessary. Again, it's merely contingent when considered in isolation, but since the whole mechanism is necessary, everything that actually happens (that exists) is necessary, and there were no other possible ways that the world could have been. That's merely a human illusion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;God as the underlying ground of everything must, then, exist outside of time. He's not like a deist might say someone who was the first cause temporally, hitting the first domino, and then the world rolled into being, with maybe us conscious beings having free will, able to do things that God didn't ultimately determine or know about. Even Leibniz (not a deist) thought that God creates the plan but then the rest runs like a perfect machine, with part of that machine being us with our free will. God determined that free will would be best for us, and so caused us to have that, but then doesn't cause our choices. For Avicenna, the relation between God and His creation is much more immediate. This "emanation" means that we're all in effect part of God, and His omniscience is explained as His knowledge of Himself. This knowledge is of course not like most human knowledge, where at some point we come to learn a fact, because Avicenna's God never changes and so can't come to learn anything, or else before that learning He would have been ignorant of that knowledge. Instead God knows everything abstractly, like the innate knowledge we have according to Plato of the Forms. Essentially, God can reason out everything that has or will happen. Even this doesn't quite capture it, because "reasoning out" sounds like a sequential process, but God's knowledge just like God's causality is immediate, or rather atemporal.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Just to give one more example, what would prove God's generosity? This sounds like a human quality that a metaphysical posit like the necessary ground of the universe could not have. But Avicenna said that generosity is defined as giving (well, emanation) without need, and God by definition doesn't have any needs, and so isn't benefited by creating the world for us. So you keep words like "know," "give," and "love," but you redefine them so they can apply to this very non-human entity. The Scriptures... well, of course they're filled with anthropomorphism, because that's what you need to reach non-philosophical readers, but philosopher who have followed Avicenna's reasoning will know how to read them correctly to get at the literal, hard-to-grasp truths beneath the human-oriented stories.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The second topic was considered is our knowledge of the soul. Avicenna's famed "flying man" experiment asks us to imagine being a person who has just been created with all mental faculties intact, but no memory (because the person has just that moment been created, full mature), and with no sensation. You're "flying" because your limbs are splayed and you can't feel the earth under you. The word is not quite apt, because you also can't feel air pressure, or gravity, or your own sense of balance. There's no sensation at all, is the point. Yet even then, Avicenna claims that you'd know that you exist.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is supposed to prove not just a la Descartes that "I think, therefore I am" but that what you are essentially, as a soul, is something non-material. Avicenna read Aristotle's definition of the soul that it's the "perfection" or "form" of the body--in other words something the body does, the state that it's in--and was unsatisfied. This is a characteristic of the soul, i.e. we encounter it in our bodies, but doesn't say what the soul actually is in itself, doesn't capture what makes the soul a soul.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to Avicenna's epistemology, when we grasp some concept, we necessary grasp its constitutive attributes, i.e. we understand what makes it as it is. Otherwise, we haven't grasped it at all. I might see a passing cow, but if I don't understand what an animal is, then I haven't really seen the cow; I've just seen a shape. Now, I might not explicitly think when I see the cow that it's an animal, and I certainly don't think explicitly about what an animal is such that it's different than a plant or inanimate matter. But all of these logical entailments are right there, implicit in my thought, according to Avicenna.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The flying man argument is supposed to call to mind a self-awareness that we always have, even if we've never explicitly considered it or not. Whenever I have any perception at all, or think any thought, I'm also implicitly aware that it's me having that perception or thought. The explicit content of my thinking of of perceiving my computer is the computer, but one of the implicit contents (along with things about the computer) is this element "me." While someone like Heidegger or Merleau-Ponty would claim that really, the "me" in that experience is always an embodied me, as in I am this body physically related to the computer in front of me, and my merely thinking of (remembering) a computer after the fact is an experienced derived from that perception, the epistemic situation according to Avicenna when it comes to knowing yourself is actually more like God's knowledge of Himself: We have this direct knowledge of self (through BEING the self) that is actually a prerequisite to our having any of these other experiences. So I don't learn about the self through having an experience of perception, but instead my prior knowledge of self is required as an ingredient for perception to be possible. I can only perceive myself as being in a body because I already have a prior understanding of myself, and I know from that prior understanding that this self does not include residing in a body as an essential component. I could (in the flying man thought experiment) have a conception of self without having had a conception of body. There's no reason to think that this conception of self was fallacious, that in the flying man situation I really wouldn't be grasping the self at all, so therefore I grasped everything essential about self-hood even in that weird, imagined situation. Therefore it's not essential that a soul be in a body, at least conceptually. In other words, it's possible for a soul to not be in a body.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;...And if you'll recall my argument that everything that's possible is in fact actual, then you can see how Avicenna uses this to show that the soul not only can but does live on without a body. The soul is experienced as contingent (possible), but in moving to its necessary ground, we don't have to say "the soul wouldn't be there unless the body was." I know as flying man that there is a soul that is me, and that it must be contingent on something, and so I can follow that chain to God, but no other links in that chain are apparent: It seems like I was directly caused by God.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can probably see why I don't agree with this argument. I don't agree with Avicenna's epistemic claim that to be able to grapple with some idea, particularly one we're experiencing, we have to understand its nature. So to me, it's perfectly plausible that the nature of the self may in fact necessarily involves its biological base, and also perfectly plausible that we might not know that even though we can think sensibly about selves. This is the common objection to Avicenna: That it violates the sense-reference distinction, as discussed in our Frege episode. For example, I can be looking at Clark Kent and not know that Clark Kent is Superman. I am in fact looking at Superman, but I don't know that. There would be no justification to say "since I'm sensibly grasping this guy Clark Kent, I have grasped his essence, and can definitively say he's not Superman." In this case, that claim would not only be unjustified, but actually wrong.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The 12th century thinker that Peter praises toward the beginning is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhr_al-Din_al-Razi" target="_blank"&gt;Fakhr al-Din al-Razi &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our main text selections for the argument for the existence of God is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872208710/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0872208710 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=cfbda8178ca1fe6d412771a808173222" target="_blank"&gt;Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources &lt;/a &gt;, translated by J.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on March 16, after our episode on Jonathan Lear.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start off with some genetic testing talk, then chat about the kinds of comments we receive and what we can and can't reasonably respond to. This leads to some recounting of our various engagement attempts over the years and what we might we willing to do in terms of seminars or course offerings, so long as we can figure out remuneration. (Yes, &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/product-category/tutoring/" target="_blank"&gt;you can still buy an hour of Mark's time for tutoring or philosophical conversation &lt;/a &gt;.) We'll let you know when Wes' Stoicism course is available. If you'd want to participate in something like our Aftershows (so talking with one of us and some other supporters after some or all of the episodes come out) for some additional fee, please reach out to us and let us know you'd want to do this and how much you think it's worth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We look forward to our Indian philosophy episode with Stephen Phillips (this will be ep. #269) and immediately to our Avicenna episode with Peter Adamson from the History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast (just to spoil it: Wes and Seth ended up not showing up for that one, but Peter is great, so it's still a rich feast).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We briefly consider an Emily Dickinson episode, but we'll probably leave that for (sub)Text.

We use this and our recent experience with Lear to think again about whether we should ever cover secondary literature or readings by people that we could conceivably have on as guests. (Several factors contributed to us not actually having Lear on the show, the main one being that he didn't respond to my email about it.) And was three Plato-related episodes in a row too much? Is there any appetite for us covering more long books covering many episodes like we did with Locke? Maybe as a study group?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on essays from Lear's &lt;em &gt;Open Minded: Working Out the Logic of the Soul &lt;/em &gt;(1988).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start off with more about the relation between comedy and tragedy and how these might relate to Plato's stories.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then provide more detail on chapter 10: "Inside and Outside the Republic," including Bernard Williams' objections to Plato and Lear's responses.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to Wes, the relation between the different parts of the Platonic soul (and the three parts of the mind for Freud) is comprehensible because they're all built out eros, of appetite, or in Freud's terminology, libido: That thymos and logos are eros sublimated. So we debate whether this reduction of the three to one basic type is justified and which type it would be: For Nietzsche, thymos as Will to Power is basic, and for Plato (according to Mark, anyway) logos is basic, because all systems are designed logically, i.e. according to scientific law and/or internal teleological forces calculated to maximize an organism's flourishing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We wrap up by considering Lear's take on Plato's warning against poetry: Given that art is a primary thing that we internalize (and that artists externalize), of course we should expect a substantial effect on society. Insofar as art is memetic (i.e. having qualities of memes, not "mimetic," which imitative, though these are related), it doesn't even require that we absorb the work of art to pass it along.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On essays from Lear's &lt;em &gt;Open Minded: Working Out the Logic of the Soul &lt;/em &gt;(1988), featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does Plato's philosophy hold together, and is it still something we can make use of in the modern age? Our recent explorations of Plato's &lt;em &gt;Timaeus &lt;/em &gt;and &lt;em &gt;Phaedo &lt;/em &gt;showed us how humanity is supposed to fit into the cosmos, but the details seemed hopelessly archaic: The Theory of Forms is problematic, and there don't seem any convincing, well-grounded reasons to believe in Plato's optimally harmonious world. But if Plato's purpose was ethical, then Socrates' mythical stories might be more about putting us in the right frame of mind to live in a just and healthy fashion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/lear" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Lear &lt;/a &gt;applies his psychoanalytic training to help modernize Plato, and we read three of his essays: "Inside and Outside the Republic," "Eros and Unknowing: The Psychoanalytic Significance of Plato’s Symposium," and "An Interpretation of Transference," which starts off by comparing Socrates' questioning with psychotherapy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The connecting thread between these essays (which are chapters 10, 7, and 4 of &lt;em &gt;Open Minded &lt;/em &gt;respectively; we also read the introductory first chapter, "The King and I") is the connection between the individual human mind and the world that we collectively create, and it's very useful to connect Lear's analysis to our social construction episodes. Plato's &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;stresses the importance of proper upbringing of citizens, because this is how we're constructed as social animals, how we internalize our culture (see also our recent Dewey on education episode). This internalization continues throughout our lives in various ways. What's trickier to describe is externalization, where through our habits, our artworks, our speech we contribute back to the culture's ongoing evolution. According to Plato, the character of a state emerges from the character of its citizens and vice versa.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lear defends the &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;against charges that the relation between psyche and polis (i.e. mind and society) is merely an analogy, and a question-begging one at that. Bernard Williams described this analogy as papering over the fundamentally oppressive character of Plato's ideal state. An individual person is one according to Plato where the rational part of the soul (the logos) is firmly in charge of the appetitive (eros) and honor-seeking (thymos) parts. These parts are necessary to motivate us to eat, reproduce, and fight in defense of family and state, but they shouldn't be making any of our decisions. Plato describes this result as a harmonious soul, a just soul, since it's reason that understands justice and will put these capacities to their best use.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But famously, if you analogize this to people and say that some people are fundamentally appetitive and so properly should be doing menial work, and some others are fundamentally thymotic and so should be the guardians, then these groups both get ruled by the wise philosopher-king class, and really, none of us today wants that kind of world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Williams argued that in order for the lower classes to understand that they need to obey, they'd actually have to be reasonable enough. But does that mean that our "gut" (the seat of eros in the &lt;em &gt;Timaeus &lt;/em &gt;) needs to also have a reasoning part? This is one of the many ways that the analogy falls apart. Another example: Plato criticized the democratic state as too diverse to have direction; it's always pulling this way and that in conflict with itself. Plato also described the state as determined by the character of its members, so that should mean that the individual citizens are also "too diverse," but this really makes no sense, as diversity is a matter of different citizens having different characters, not a matter of each citizen having different characters.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lear's essay on the &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;responds by saying that the relationship between soul and society is not analogical but this literal, causal, metabolic process of internalization and externalization that I've described. One misleading factor is that we only notice that the parts of the soul are different when they're in conflict, but of course they're not usually in conflict at all; most of us are not at constant war with ourselves. As Socrates describes in the &lt;em &gt;Phaedo &lt;/em &gt;, the truly temperate person is not someone who has these strong urges that they're constantly having to tamp down, but someone who's been habituated to not have these urges at all. So the eros-dominated person in society is not one who is ceaselessly seeking to satisfy their pleasure, but one who has been educated to only have essential desires, not frivolous or excessive ones, and who uses rationality to maximize pleasure by being able to put off some pleasures in service of greater pleasure overall. Such a person does use rationality, then, despite still being dominated overall by personal desire, and can rationally acknowledge that it's those who are wise at ruling who should actually rule.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Lear, the way we can tell if a personal way of balancing yourself makes sense is whether it can be externalized to a coherent society. Plato's analysis of the democratic citizen is that they don't have a strong will, that they are pulled hither and thither by any influence that comes along. That really is a self-conflicted individual, and when externalized to a society, we get the whimsical democracy that Plato warned us against. A tyrannical individual soul is one who is really a servant of their own desires, and when this is externalized, you get a society with a tyrant at the top, i.e. this tyrannical soul, and everyone else oppressed into serving those desires. It's only the just, well-balanced soul, at peace with itself that can be externalized into a just society according to Plato.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lear compares the three parts of the soul for Plato to Freud's three parts of the psyche and correlates the development of those three parts for Freud from a more primitive picture of conscious vs. unconscious to the development from Socrates' view where there's just a person and their mutually contradictory beliefs (or more broadly, the mind's rationality against the unreason of the body) to Plato's view of parts of the soul that help to explain some of our conflicts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lear's essay on the &lt;em &gt;Symposium &lt;/em &gt;adds to this picture by meditating on eros and its role in supposedly connecting us to the divine. While in the &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;, eros is just the desiring part of the soul, in Socrates' speech in &lt;em &gt;Symposium &lt;/em &gt;, eros is the messenger to the divine; it can self-transcend as our merely animal lust points the way to appreciating beauty not just embodied in an individual but the Form of Beauty itself. As Lear tells it, this picture is undermined in the dialogue when Alcibiades, presented as the incarnation of beauty (i.e. he was super hot), stumbles drunkenly into the party and praises Socrates even as he says that he's unable to commit to following Socrates' teachings.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This according to Lear is not just the comedy it reads as, but is also tragedy: Eros tries to catch the divine but is continually unable to do so, much like the half-beings Aristophanes--in his speech earlier in the dialogue--describes as constantly searching for their other half, so sex is an attempt to biologically merge that is inevitably unsuccessful.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the &lt;em &gt;Timaeus &lt;/em &gt;, the emphasis was the harmony of the universe, but Plato (through the character of Timaeus) admitted that yes, of course there is suffering, and plenty of opportunities for things to go out of balance. These are just inevitable byproducts of being embodied in the first place, and the only escape from them is (per the &lt;em &gt;Phaedo &lt;/em &gt;) to live and then die as a philosopher. But what if instead of evaluating the plausibility of Plato's grand visions of the universe and the afterlife, we diagnose them? One process of externalization is putting forward explanations for things, and the primary form for this is not scientific theory but storytelling: We paint the world to make it a sensible place to live in. So the attempt to depict the world as ultimately harmonious and these problems we run into as just blips in an optimal grand scheme is an attempt to live with and grapple with suffering.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What Lear argues against in &lt;em &gt;Open Minded &lt;/em &gt;is not that such externalization is bad. It can't be; it's a fundamental way we move in the world. However, when it becomes dogma, when it is no longer useful for the situations we have to cope with, when it causes conflict with other people, then to be open minded is to be able to put such externalizations aside to make way for new ones. In his introductory chapter he anticipates the objections of hard-nosed analytic philosophers to anything Freudian, or Lacanian, or having to do with any of the other parts of philosophy that many find suspect, to be "not real philosophy." We can't let the desire for rigor, for high academic standards, rule out in advance whole theoretical frameworks like psychoanalysis, Marxism, or post-structuralism that many have found very useful. We can't make excuses for being ignorant of these thinkers. Lear specifically criticizes Karl Popper's approach whereby you simply ask "is the theory falsifiable given appropriate evidence?" and then dismiss these tools as unscientific and hence useless. Lear's thinking provides a model that involves both analytic philosophy and more "literary" thinking that reinterprets both Plato and Freud to try to make them more palatable and useful to us now.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the case of &lt;em &gt;The Symposium &lt;/em &gt;, Lear's essay focuses on a comment right toward the end that a great playwright should be able to write both comedy and tragedy. Lear interprets this as an invitation to read Plato's dialogue itself as both comic and tragic alternately, and so emphasizes as I've said both the explicit, harmonious view of eros connecting us to the divine and the implicit discord between eros (desire) and leading a good life, which is stated explicitly in &lt;em &gt;The Republic &lt;/em &gt;. I think this is supposed to tell us something about how we run aground against our own externalizations, which is a common theme throughout these essays.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The essay on transference describes how this commonly discussed phenomenon in therapy whereby a patient transfers emotions felt for parents or others onto the analyst is a type of externalization. We normally see the patient's attitude here as simply mistaken, but because externalization is literally how we build the social world, it's not just a matter of confusing true with false but part of the dynamics of creating what truth is, and the relation between the image of the world, including society, that each of erects (our private "idiopolis") and the shared social vision that constitutes society is complex.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To engage in transference (in other essays, Lear uses the term "phantasy" to capture similar phenomena) is to put forth a social proposition, which in the case with the analyst is "we are lovers" or "we are enemies" (or both). The proper response for the analyst is of course to deny both of these and to instead help the patient understand the social move being made.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Socrates, according to Lear, did not understand transference. Socrates' method of questioning is supposed to help people, and it's part of Socratic doctrine that people don't like being hurt and know and appreciate when they're being helped. Yet the Athenian people that Socrates were trying to help felt attacked, and they transferred that rage (which should have been directed against their own inconsistency and other flaws) back at Socrates himself, putting him to death.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Alcibiades in &lt;em &gt;The Symposium &lt;/em &gt;accuses Socrates of being his tormentor: His lover who frustrates him, who he can't look away from but also can't follow the way they both would like. Socrates should have in this case been a good therapist and understood that this was all Alcibiades' problem, and worked to help him, but instead he plays along with the farce and (according to Lear) ultimately doesn't care about the plight of people who can't put their rationality in charge of their behavior and follow him along the philosophers' path. This is tragic, according to Lear; Alcibiades famously betrayed Athens.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In both of these cases, by Lear's diagnosis the Athenian experiment in democracy failed because of its inability to appreciate and follow Socrates' advice, the implication being that we are always in danger of failing in our social goals because of a lack of understanding of ourselves and how we work together, and so this is what Lear hopes to help remedy in giving us the analyses that he does through his essays, just as he tries to help his psychoanalytic patients individually and directly.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3djhaEF" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/openminded00jona_0" target="_blank"&gt;it looks like you can borrow it online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on March 2, after &lt;em &gt;Phaedo &lt;/em &gt;and before our upcoming episode on Jonathan Lear. You might want to get ahold of his book &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674455339/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674455339 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=8116f2a84e652019999e4d94220b0e7a" target="_blank"&gt;Open Minded: Working Out the Logic of the Soul &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. We read chapters 1, 10, 7, and 4, in that order; they all concern Plato.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dylan tells us about &lt;a href="https://www.wimhofmethod.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Wim Hof &lt;/a &gt;, and then we talk about death! No, that argument that we shouldn't fear death because either a) it's nothing and so wouldn't bother us or b) if there is an afterlife, it's likely not unpleasant is not in the Crito, which only covers whether Socrates owes it to the state to stick around for his execution. Does Parfit's view of the self help Plato's argument about the immortal soul? Probably not.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Then, some letters: A nice one from Cambodia and one asking "Is PEL Over?" It is not.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark gives an update on his book (yes, this is a thing, and talking about it in Nightcaps may help to keep it being a thing, though strenuous podcast reading assignments have interrupted it for most of the last week). Can we take egalitarianism seriously and not be snobs as philosophers (or as people)? What is psychologically wrong with each of us hosts? We compare the sizes of our egos and talk about the role of self-deprecation in podcasting.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Who can predict who will stop by in Seth's house while we're trying to record? Recurrent Nightcap listeners certainly can.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The guy from Cambodia wanted to share this video: "Here is a crazy-beautiful collaborative music video for Human Rights Day, made with a dozen amazing youth NGOs and hundreds of young painters and performers from a social arts and circus school in rural Battambang, Cambodia.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on Plato's dialogue depicting the death of Socrates from around 390 BCE.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get more into the details of Plato's cosmology as described by the dialogue, including laying out his various proofs for the immortality of the soul.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;First, Socrates puts forth the principle of physics that things always emerge from their opposites. For instance, where do soft things come from? From the breaking up of hard things! And where do these hard things come from? From the (probably very slow) compression of soft things. Small things (babies) come from big things (adults), and the small things then grow into big things. More generally, what else could something come from but its opposite? So therefore life must come out of death and vice versa; Socrates interprets this to mean that the our living souls must have come from the land of the dead before and will return there after we die, with a cycle of rebirth that will only (a la Buddhism) cease when we are philosophical enough for our souls to completely break away from worldly things after death and instead live among the gods.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So why wouldn't this rule apply to the soul itself, such that it would come to be from dead nothingness (lack of soul) and then go back to nothingness? The soul must be like those eternal things that are immune from this physical law, which applies only to the changeable world of the senses. We lay out the theory of Forms (these eternal things) as this dialogue describes it. How does perceiving something in the world remind us of this Form that is so different from any mortal thing? The myth Socrates tells at the end of the dialogue implies that there are Forms not just for abstract principles like Number, Unity, and Heat but for specific things including species of flora and fauna, people, and even artifacts. But how could there be Forms, which definition don't have parts, for composite objects in our world? For Plato's later thoughts on the problems with this theory, see our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-198-platos-in-21178125"&gt;episode 198 on his dialogue &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-198-platos-in-21178125"&gt;Parmenides &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here's another crummy argument for the immortality of the soul: The soul is the boss of the body; it tells the body where to move, what to do, how to comport itself. So it would be strange if this general were so much weaker than its privates that it would just die off even as our bones stick around for a long time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The above is in response to Simmias, one of Socrates' interlocutors, who argues that maybe the soul is like the harmony that comes out of the strings of a lyre. So of course when the strings aren't being played, or they break, then there's no harmony. This is a functionalist view that's very much like what Aristotle comes up with: The mind is something the body (at least the brain) does, so of course when the body dies, there's nothing left to keep doing that activity. But Simmias pretty quickly accepts that this image is just a prejudice received from culture, whereas Socrates' alleged proofs from recollection and the like are sound philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There's an interesting section at the point where Simmias and his friend Cebes give their objections where Socrates considers "misology," i.e. hatred of arguments, which might well happen when you're convinced of something (like Socrates' initial arguments) but then hear some sound-sounding objections (from Simmias and Cebes... Cebes' argument is that maybe even if the soul lasts longer than any particular body, it still might eventually wear out) that throw your prior certainty into doubt. Socrates points out that this is just a trap for the unskilled who accept arguments uncritically: The problem isn't with arguments as such, but with you for being so gullible as to accept bad ones.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Socrates also around this point explains why he isn't so into natural philosophy (speculation about physics): He read Anaxagoras and was excited by the idea that Nous (intelligence) controls everything, but was disappointed that Anaxagoras didn't follow through on this insight in the way that we see Plato eventually do through the character of Timaeus. If intelligence is the prime mover of the universe, then things should be designed as well was possible, and so Socrates thinks that he can reasonably assume that something like his mythical picture of the wonderful afterlife must be the case: Because he's been a diligent philosopher, directed by philosophy toward the Good, which tells us (or told Plato, at least) that virtue is rewarded. We've seen in other dialogues (&lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;, &lt;em &gt;Gorgias &lt;/em &gt;) that this applies to this life: A wicked person free from restraint and guilt might seem to be happier than a virtuous person, but such a villain is the servant of desire and will inevitably end up unhappy, whereas the virtuous person has achieved harmony in the soul, which is our naturally happy state. If the universe is well constructed, then this must also apply to the afterlife: There must be justice there even if there wasn't apparent justice on earth. This picture had an enormous influence on Christian thinkers rediscovering Plato.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Socrates Dancing" by Dylan Casey, recorded 2001. &lt;a href="http://dylancasey.org/neutrinosessions.html" target="_blank"&gt;Hear more &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Plato's middle dialogue depicting the death of Socrates from around 390 BCE, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Should we fear death? Plato's dialogue shows Socrates conversing with his followers immediately before his execution about the philosophical life and the immortality of the soul.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Philosophy as Socrates preaches it is preparation for death: It is a conscious turning away from worldly goods like pleasure, money, and fame in favor of the eternal, and Socrates is confident that after death he'll be back in the presence of that eternal and can barely wait to get going.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nominally, the dialogue is a proof of the immortality of the soul, and here's the gist: The soul is what makes things alive, right? As the element (whatever it is) that endows life to dead matter, it is, by definition, life itself. So also by definition, it cannot die; it must in fact live on. Plato gives a lot more supporting detail, but yes, the argument is that bad.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The real historic significance here, though, is that in the course of building up to this, Plato gives his first account of the theory of Forms, but strangely, only in passing: Even though this is Plato's first time using the term, Socrates' interlocutors in the story have heard it many times before, and so they're just getting a refresher here. How do we know that the soul just isn't the body itself metabolizing (or whatever the body does that makes it alive) and actually a separate entity that could exist apart from that body? Because in doing geometry, for example, Plato thought we could only perform deductions because we had before-birth knowledge of basic geometric principles. (The &lt;em &gt;Meno &lt;/em &gt;that this example comes from was probably the dialogue written just before this one. That dialogue developed this theory of recollection but stopped short of positing Forms.) So mind-body dualism is necessary due to the way our minds work.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to Plato, when we experience something like a drawing of a triangle, we recognize that it is supposed to be a triangle, but also recognize that it falls short of real triangularity. We recognize that this physical thing (the drawing) is somehow imitating this perfect Form, triangularity. If we didn't have prior knowledge of this form, we wouldn't be able to make sense of our perception at all. Socrates refers to how "we all know" that the world of our perceptions is deceptive (the dialogue doesn't actually take us through skeptical exercises like a stick looking bent in water, but this is what he means), that everything in the phenomenal world is always changing. For a word to actually name something, it has to nail it down, it has to actually be picking out a concept, which is not a changing thing in the world, but is a fixed Idea, and I'm capitalizing the word "Idea" because that's what a Form is: part of an Ideal world, standing above and behind the world of our perception, invisible to us but implicitly referred to by our every cognitive act. Philosophy is an ongoing process of questioning the assumptions of the phenomenal world, turning away from this shifting parade of shadows by seeing how they imply this ultimately more real world of unchanging, Ideal Ideas.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So we've got two types of beings established: the visible ones and the invisible ones. You don't see the soul, do you? Therefore it's one of the invisible ones, part of the Ideal world, which as the party has agreed is eternal. Therefore the soul is eternal. More flawless logic!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Interestingly, Socrates admits that he doesn't really need to set up an unassailable proof here. He just needs to convince himself, so that he can face his death without fear. Near the end of the dialogue, he gives a long cosmological myth about how he thinks the heavens are set up in relation to the earth and what he thinks exactly his soul will do after it leaves his body. There's no way that this level of detail follows from any of the preceding reasoning, so what's going on there?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There's something about myth-making, about philosophical story-telling that is therapeutic. We erect philosophical theories to make sense of the world so as to live well in it. Could it be that Plato told this story not because he literally believed all the words coming out of Socrates' mouth, but to show this process of good story-telling that enlivens us to face a tough world? Despite Socrates' insistence that his death is not a bad thing, the story Plato told with this dialogue is a tragedy of a good man killed unjustly, and all the supporting characters are very sad contra Socrates' wishes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This ironic interpretation of Plato would perhaps excuse the bad arguments, but there's a danger of circularity: Philosophy is undoubtedly on Plato's account supposed to make us better people, but the only reason we know that is that philosophy tells us so by revealing this general structure of the world by which we mortals are able through philosophy to lift our eyes to the divine. So clearly at least that much needs to be taken in earnest lest Plato's alleged irony corrode the foundation he claimed for philosophy's being an ethically positive force.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2OC8l02" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the David Gallop 1975 translation &lt;/a &gt;that we read or &lt;a href="http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Phil_100/Plato_files/310585462-Plato-Phaedo.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on Feb. 21 after our Timaeus discussion, we start with Seth's tales of Austin with no power, which is why he missed that discussion. Dylan was traveling in the northwest and was also affected.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But this is not just all about the weather. We fill Seth in on what he missed and look forward to the &lt;em &gt;Phaedo &lt;/em &gt;, and later, Avicenna with Peter Adamson, and we're looking at another on Indian philosophy to do in a couple of months with one of our ex-profs, Stephen Phillips. Mark and Wes reflect back on assisting him in teaching a non-Western intro to philosophy course as our first grad school teaching assignment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about what to do for a short-turnaround ep. after the &lt;em &gt;Phaedo &lt;/em &gt;, which after this recording we decided will be on a couple of essays about Plato (specifically about &lt;em &gt;The Symposium &lt;/em &gt;and &lt;em &gt;The Republic &lt;/em &gt;) by Jonathan Lear. Get the book: &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674455339/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674455339 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=cf19b8f5b3106ae2ca11e4b496a3c7fd" target="_blank"&gt;Open Minded: Working Out the Logic of the Soul &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Listen to Wes's old (sub)Text episode on &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/03/25/subtext5-chekhov-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Uncle Vanya &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on the &lt;em &gt;Timaeus &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this second part, we go more or less back to the beginning of the dialogue and talk through some quotes and details. For instance, we have arguments concerning the realms of Being and Becoming, the former being the model which the Craftsman used to create the latter. Could the model itself have been created? No, anything in that realm of eternal Being is by definition uncaused, i.e. uncreated, not actually existing in time at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So if creation wasn't an actual act that took place in time, but was rather somehow the logic of embodied existence exhibiting itself, then is the Craftsman a god in any kind of recognizable sense, or is it more a poetic way of talking about the principles by which the universe is structured? How similar is this story really to Leibniz's story about God creating the best possible world?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What are the alternatives to this principle of creation? Plato mentions Empedocles, who had a more "atoms in the void" picture of the universe, where creation somehow occurs just through principles like "like attracts like." Plato thought this view was totally inadequate; even if the Craftsman doesn't end up having a personality in any recognizable sense, its principle of making the universe based on a perfect model seems much more fruitful in deriving the way the world actually appears to us, given that figures like Empedocles didn't have Darwinian concepts at their disposal to explain why a universe that is random at its root might appear ordered.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So how literally should we take the creation story that &lt;em &gt;Timaeus &lt;/em &gt;articulates? Does it express Plato's literal view? If the world we experience is ever-changing, then strictly speaking, words can't even refer to it. They only refer to stable, eternal things (Forms for Plato, human-created abstract concepts for an empiricist like Locke). So a theory about nature must according to this Platonic picture of language be literally false. It must instead be some kind of poetry to raise our eyes to eternal things and so orient us ethically.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the later Platonic dialogue from around 360 BCE, with Mark, Wes, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How is nature put together? Plato, speaking this time through the fictional character instead of Socrates (who is present, but only Timaeus talks after the first part of the dialogue), paints a picture of the creation of the cosmos and our place in it. The overall principle is the same as it was later for Leibniz: The "Craftsman" (sometimes translated as the "Demi-Urge") creates everything to be as perfect as possible, and this single principle is enough to allow Plato to come up with a "likely story" about the world. The story is only "likely" because it's about nature, which is changeable and murky, unlike the timeless, perfect world which Timaeus says that the Craftsman used as a model to create our world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He doesn't say a whole lot about this perfect world, but since (according to Platonic philosophy) this perfect world of Forms exists, then of course a good Craftsman (i.e. God) would use this as the model for creating our actual world. However, with embodiment comes compromise. For instance, to protect our brains, our skull should be as thick as possible. But the need for us to sense the world conflicts with that, so we get the skull we have, with some good protection but also with vulnerable holes in it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Timaeus' account is divided between descriptions of the creations of intelligence, which is the fundamental cosmology, then the creations of necessity, which is about these "compromises" that come with embodiment, i.e. fundamental physics, and then about how intelligence and necessity work together, which includes biology. The beginning and end of the dialogue make the context clear: This whole cosmology is part of an account of how we fit in the world and hence how we're supposed to behave.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what is the best possible cosmos like? Well, it's a sphere (Parmenides agreed), with nothing outside it, and it rotates, because movement is good, and, well, there's nowhere for it to go, so spinning is the best kind of movement. It's also alive: it has soul baked right into it, even though it doesn't need sense organs (there's nothing outside of it to sense!). What having a soul, having life, amounts to is following one's nature, which again in the case of the whole universe is just to spin, fully self-sufficient and happy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is this sphere made of? Well, the Craftsman combined the unchanging indivisible substance (you know, the kind that Forms are), and combined it with the divided, changing substance (Becoming, i.e. the world as our senses encounter it). The result is an intermediate substance that has both identity and difference in it. By adding these elements, the Craftsman was able to create all the planets and stars that revolve around us, again, moving in a circle, which is apparently interesting enough to constitute all that these very much living, intelligent beings have to do. And the movement of these heavenly bodies literally creates time, so it's not that time was passing and the Craftsman was doing things in time like your or I would, but the Craftsman is more like the Judeo-Christian God in being unbounded by time, and so descriptions like "first the Craftsman made combined these types of matter and then made the planets" have to be understood as merely similar by analogy to how we create things in time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;After time was going, though the Craftsman did create the rest of the Greek gods and gave them instructions for making us. Where do our souls come from? Well, the Craftsman mixed the leftover ingredients from creating the universe (and these leftovers were less pure than the stuff used to make the heavens), and made our souls, which were not yet in bodies, but more hanging out with the Forms so that we could later dimly recall them after being born.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The important new element in the second section of the dialogue about physics is the "receptacle" (aka the chora). This may just be another way of putting the earlier point about the eternal stuff being mixed with the worldly stuff, but here he talks about the Forms being the father of creation and the receptacle being the mother. Keep in mind with this analogy that belief in ancient Greece that it's entirely the father's DNA (of course no one called it that) that determines the character of the baby, and the mother's womb just provided the material that the baby was made out of. So it's like the Forms (the perfect realm that the Craftsman used as the model for creation) provide a blueprint, and then the receptacle is this entirely characterless stuff that the blueprint is realized in. Timaeus gives the analogy of making a perfume: before you add the scented elements, you have to have some unscented material (presumably water) to add the scent to. Or maybe the Forms are like stamps that give specific shapes to plain wax. Chora is sometimes translated as just "space," but this isn't exactly right, because there's no empty space for Plato any more than there's an empty grid of time that things then happen in. Rather, time as I said is literally created by the motion of the heavenly bodies, and space is just matter. So the receptacle is just featureless matter that becomes particular elements (air, fire, water, earth) by being crafted into certain three-dimensional solids based on triangles: This is called geometric atomism, where earth has cubic atoms and fire has very pointy ones, which explains what burning is: being hit with a bunch of very pointy molecules that pierce and destroy things, and this sort of disruption is called heat.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The third part of the dialogue about biology gets into these sorts of interactions between our bodies and our environments. First it describes how our bodies were optimally put together: You've got that well protected head which houses the rational part of the soul, well positioned to be in charge, and then of course that head should be able to move around the environment, which is why we have legs. The body has to nourish itself, which is why we have the guts (which are as far as possible away from the head so that they don't exert undue control over that head), and it needs to strive and defend itself, which is why we have the heart and lungs. These are the famed three parts of the Platonic soul: reason, spirit, and appetite, and they're all set up there inside us to be properly balanced, i.e. with the head giving the orders, helped by the heart. Even the guts have their uses, of course, and an organ such as the liver will tell us if we're abusing it by letting off bile to make us feel bad.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;And so this is the message of self-care: Keep your soul in balance, rotating as it were just like the heavenly spheres, and it's in fact contemplation of those heavenly bodies that brings out our philosophical spirit and teaches us how to likewise move in the harmonious way appropriate to us. So education is key: We start out life as children ruled more or less by our guts, and without proper education, we may remain that way, and so become slaves to gluttony or avarice or other out-of-balance goals instead of being ruled by reason. But this is not because we're evil by nature, or that we freely choose evil, or that the Craftsman has made a mistake. As with my example of the skull with holes, everything about our biology is a compromise between competing goals, and the very phenomenon of mortal embodiment means that our bodies will break down eventually and have certain vulnerabilities. The circumstance of upbringing may well make some people remain slaves of their guts, and hence probably die early, whereas the best and peaceful way to die is just for the continual onslaught of atoms against our person (again, just an unavoidable fact of embodiment in the physical world) to eventually wear us down. And when one body dies, its soul is still around to potentially go into other bodies or just hang around in the eternal realm.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3q31Wru" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the translation by Robin Waterfield that we read &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html" target="_blank"&gt;read an older translation online &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://librivox.org/timaeus-by-plato/" target="_blank"&gt;LibriVox also offers a free audiobook version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on Feb. 5 after the Lise Van Boxel discussion, we engage in some focused post-gaming on that: How did people like PEL covering a secondary source in this way? How did you like our having two guests; was it just as good as having the four of us on?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also consider a potential future episode on Alain Badiou, who's been often requested. Should we invite a scholar guest on to that?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we anticipate Plato's &lt;em &gt;Timaeus &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on &lt;em &gt;Warspeak: Nietzsche's Victory Over Nihilism &lt;/em &gt;with guests Jeff Black and Michael Grenke.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get more into how Lise describes the relationship of the feminine principle of Becoming with the masculine principle of Being. This should be "agnoistic" (creative tension!) and involves seduction, just like Nietzsche's writing style seduces readers into hanging on his every word. There needs to be an element of dynamic play, as opposed to the mere subservience of asceticism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Just as we made clear in ep. 262 that asceticism is not merely the bad that's opposed to Nietzsche's life-affirming good, the Being that Nietzsche seems elsewhere to simply condemn needs to be in a yin-yang relationship with Becoming, where each involves elements of the other and both are necessary components in a flexible set of values. Nietzsche's ideal is often characterized as "becoming what you are," and that paradoxical way of putting it conveys this relationship. It's not like an acorn that has a destiny of becoming an oak tree, where the mature oak is the unchanging form which the actual plant is striving to imitate (a la Plato).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Instead, Being itself needs to be re-evaluated: We don't shoot for a static goal, nor do we want to drift aimlessly, but the goal itself shifts as we become wiser through experience. Everything is always changing, but within those changes there is persistence, which is Being: There are things that are stable enough to value. To be concrete about this, consider a love relationship between two people, where there should be something persistent about it even as the individuals and their ways of loving and lovable qualities mutate over time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lise gives as another practical example our attitude towards illness. Is illness merely a falling-short of the ideal human form? Women experience pregnancy, which has many of the characteristics of illness, but which results in new life. So one example of Becoming is the cycling between illness and health (between less and more vitality), and this needn't be seen as a flaw, but as a necessary condition for life.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another example considered here that was very important to Nietzsche is comedy, and the creation of artworks more generally, where there's on the one hand deep involvement in the creation (laughing at the joke) and on the other an ironic or otherwise creative distance between the comedian and the situation described or the artist and the world created through the artwork (this world, being fictional, is an "honest lie" in that it is upfront about being fictional and also trying to convey philosophical truths as the artist understands them). And again, why does Nietzsche write the way he does, in this teasing, ironic manner, not just telling us what the new value system is (e.g. that Zarathustra is the new ideal)? His works enact a seduction strategy designed to engage us and change us, not just put a "Being" (his philosophy) before us fully formed, but to engender a co-operative creation between author and reader, between sage and audience. We should never even be sure that we're Nietzsche's intended audience, so that we gain a certain distance from what he's telling us and don't just follow him like sheep. For more Nietzsche-inspired thoughts about writing, see &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/04/01/ep212-sartre-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our ep. 212 Satre on Literature &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;All this culminates in Lise's account of the sovereign individual. We are being trained to be able to make decisions for ourselves, and even though that sounds like accepting the burden of responsibility, we need to keep in mind the "airborne flight of the psyche" that is also involved. Simply accepting responsibility isn't enough; it's the responsibility of self-creation, which sheep aren't even capable of even if they call themselves "responsible" in dutifully bowing down to higher powers (getting a job, working hard in school, etc.). We are not only the animal that has learned to make promises (as Nietzsche puts it) but the animal that can re-think values and so break promises, i.e. the commitments to various values we used to cherish as we evolve beyond them. This "evolution" is not arbitrariness or whim, but the changes endemic to life itself and consequently us as living individuals in charge of ourselves. In informing how we grow, we should seek to dialectally incorporate the good parts of all (or maybe only some, depending on you and your circumstances?) the types of ascetics Nietzsche criticizes in his essay.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lise was one of the hosts of PEL network podcast &lt;a href="http://combatandclassics.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Combat &amp;amp; Classics &lt;/a &gt;and a &lt;a href="https://johnscollege.academia.edu/LisevanBoxel" target="_blank"&gt;St. John's Santa Fe tutor &lt;/a &gt;. She passed away last year, but not before finishing her life's work, &lt;em &gt;Warspeak &lt;/em &gt;, which evolved over many years out of her dissertation on Nietzsche's &lt;em &gt;Genealogy of Morals &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dylan and Seth are joined by guests Michael Grenke and Jeff Black (both &lt;a href="https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/faculty/annapolis" target="_blank"&gt;teach at St. John's in Annapolis &lt;/a &gt;; Jeff co-hosts C &amp;amp;C) to discuss largely the last two chapters (6 and 7), which begin as a commentary on the &lt;em &gt;Genealogy &lt;/em &gt;'s third essay on asceticism, as covered in our ep. 262, and then go on to give Lise's counter-ideal to asceticism, which is an attempt to make the positive advice of Nietzsche's often very criticism-centered philosophy concrete and actionable. A key to this is her emphasis on what Nietzsche doesn't say about the exceptional women that he calls "seducers" who like philosophers, artists, and scientists, use the ascetic ideal in crafty and at least partially life-affirming ways that point to a road against asceticism at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In short, the "serious men" who lead our society are weighed down by what Lise calls the moral-theological prejudice, which at its extreme takes the form of belief in original sin. We believe in all sorts of usually implicit ways that we are doomed by the curse of Adam to lives of boring work, that life is suffering (as the Buddhists say), that we are by default neglecting all sorts of important duties to God and our fellow men. But the liberating thing about existentialism is that none of this is true: We are not born with any nature, any teleology that implies that we &lt;em &gt;simply must &lt;/em &gt;do anything in particular, and while we have numerous urges and tendencies and complex psychological and physiological default (and in many cases totally unavoidable) mechanisms for coping with the world that we ignore at our peril, none of this need determine our values.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Now, an existentialist like Sartre interprets this freedom as something of a curse, in that we then have the &lt;em &gt;responsibility &lt;/em &gt;to determine these values, lest we merely in bad faith take what's handed to us. This kind of concern is reflected in Nietzsche's writings through elements like his eternal recurrence thought experiment, where as we act we are to imagine that this act will happen again and again through eternity. This seems to give grave import to even the most trivial act, and pushes us to really sort out our values and commit to them rather than frittering away our time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nonetheless, in Nietzsche and in the thoughts that reading him inspired in Lise, the thing we should realize in getting rid of the moral-theological prejudice is a lightness, and Lise thought that considering the position of woman, who was through no intended boon denied social responsibility, can give us a flavor of what this lightness, this poetic and comic approach to the world, can look like. While the serious man (and I'm using this term as developed by &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/05/30/episode-140-1-beauvoir/" target="_blank"&gt;Beauvoir &lt;/a &gt;, another feminist Nietzschean) places value in some &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin" target="_blank"&gt;MacGuffin &lt;/a &gt;, those women who were historically denied association with the ideal are actually free from its tyranny and can recognize the actual value in the everyday things around us, our actual human possibilities in the world, instead of devaluing them in favor of some other world. We can have hope in our capacities to make positive change in this world and be satisfied in doing so, instead of just being weary of the human condition and wanting really to escape.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ch. 6, "The Warrior's Riddle," has to do with unraveling why Nietzsche writes the &lt;em &gt;Genealogy &lt;/em &gt;'s third essay the way that he does, but also this "riddle" (an important one, like the riddle of the sphinx, where the sphinx kills you if you don't guess it) is the riddle of why the ascetic ideal is so prevalent, Nietzsche's answer being that it's a tool of the will to power. To "re-value values" as Nietzsche's project entails means not just coming up with brand-new values, but reworking what we're given, so we have things like asceticism with a long history, and as life-denying as this can be, it's something that can serve as raw materials for our own creative valuation. We can use ascetic strategies to create life-affirming things, like how Lise used self-discipline to write her book. By analyzing the various types of people who employ the ascetic ideal, Nietzsche is (in Lise's interpretation) trying to find how they in fact are in fact drawing on this life-affirming will to power and not on inspiration from the otherworldly MacGuffin.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So we've got some discussion of science and scientism in this episode: A scientist who aims to make entirely "value-free" judgments is pursuing an ideal that denies the value of doing science or anything else. And writing: Words themselves are energizing; they're tools for changing other people. Finally, to return to the feminist aspect of Lise's book, Nietzsche mentions "seducers" as a type of ascetic, but then writes only about the mass of women who are "work slaves" and so covered by his account of slave morality more generally and the priests that rule over it. Lise fills in the blanks by connecting this absence of an account of seducers by connecting it to other comments of Nietzsche associating the feminine soul with becoming (and males with being): Woman has a "preeminently supple soul" and is akin to "the excellent actor" who can fulfill many roles. A woman has to transform herself to fit in; she is an artist of herself, her own artistic production. This description, though on its face pretty misogynistic per Nietzsche's reputation, actually accords well with the light, dancing ethic that is the "gay" part of Nietzsche's "gay science" (equally well translated as "cheerful wisdom"). To be a whole person and avoid the "seriousness" involved with the moral-theological prejudice means being in touch with those personality aspects associated with both sexes, to have both lightness and weight in counter-balancing degrees.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy Lise's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tqOfFN" target="_blank"&gt;Warspeak: Nietzsche's Victory Over Nihilism &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Audio editing by Tyler Hislop.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on Jan. 28, we first consider the question "what are the dumbest ideas in philosophy?" The particular Philosophers' Zone episode that our questioner pointed us to was &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/the-worst-argument-in-the-world/3962552" target="_blank"&gt;this one on "The Worst Argument in the World.&lt;/a &gt;"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We consider again the Angela Davis episode idea as a way of getting into a discussion of our coverage or inclusion of controversial or even criminal writers and guests. What about Judith Butler? John Searle? Louis CK? Colin McGinn? (&lt;a href="https://existentialcomics.com/comic/3" target="_blank"&gt;Here's that Existential Comics &lt;/a &gt;that responded to the McGinn scandal.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, Seth expresses some COVID-related fatigue about reading philosophy, particularly if that philosophy is more abstract and less political. So we're going to do &lt;a href="http://hs.umt.edu/ghr/documents/152ArendtOnTheNatureofTotalitarianismAnEssayinUnderstanding-Copy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;more Hannah Arendt &lt;/a &gt;. Seth is reading &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300144253/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0300144253 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=28125d5ef7ea3e228f97557a6effde2a" target="_blank"&gt;Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. Does our recent Nietzsche episode show that contra Wes, the truth isn't prior to the good, so we shouldn't just read things to push a political agenda? What can Dylan's flight from chilliness to Santa Fe teach us about the Zen of coping?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;[I have no idea why the audio wasn't showing up in my previous posting of this, as it was there when I put the post into edit mode, so I'm just making a fresh post and removing the old one.]&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on Friedrich Nietzsche's &lt;em &gt;The Genealogy of Morals &lt;/em &gt;(1887), "Third essay: what do ascetic ideals mean?"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start out with a little summarizing, trying to fit asceticism into Nietzsche's overall morality as it moves forward from the slave revolt over master/animal morality, turning to how Nietzsche uses asceticism to critique how scientists see their own activity, the one-sidedness that makes them too serious and so prevents them from questioning their own pursuit of truth. We connect this to our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/10/11/ep44-new-atheists-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;episode 44 on the new atheists &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nietzsche describes the ascetic ideal itself as the goal that we subordinate everything else too, but this is clearly wrong, because asceticism is as Nietzsche has described it is the &lt;em &gt;way &lt;/em &gt;in which we revere things, not the explicit object of reverence. Nietzsche also characterizes these acts of reverence as nihilistic, as if they are explicitly praising nothingness, but of course this is his analysis, not the manifest content of people's acts and beliefs. According to Nietzsche, in excessively praising the otherworldly, which includes such ideas as absolute truth (which by definition we can only reach closer to but never actually possess), absolute goodness, and absolute beauty, we debase the things around us (ascetically denying ourselves their pleasures) in favor of the unattainable, and so our goal is in fact empty: this pursuit is in pursuit of literally nothing, and so it's nihilistic.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We spend some more time on the function of the priest, which is not wholly negative. The priest provides a narcotic for the masses by channeling their resentment, which allows them to avoid depression even while it engenders unhealthy self-critique as well as demonization of various Others, which of course are not so good.  There's a dangerously thin line between healthy sublimation and destructive re-orientation. Likewise, there's a kind of romanticism that Nietzsche is against, but the commandment to "seize the day" usually characteristic of romanticism applies equally well to the kind of attitude Nietzsche is in favor of. This closeness of the good and the bad shouldn't be seen as a confusion or being-fucked-up-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder relativism, but an acknowledgement that there are common psychological mechanisms at work, and that even negative strategies for coping with life can be repurposed in positive ways (and vice versa; the sick can take even the best tools and use them to make themselves sicker).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We briefly try to apply Nietzsche's social critique to modern politics: Both self-torturing liberals and cultish conservatives are guilty of what Nietzsche would consider bad strategies. What is it to have a "war on" something like drugs; This is an aspect of the ascetic ideal, where we put aside normal balancing considerations to defeat what has been labeled as an existential threat. For more attempts to modernize N's political commentary, see our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/12/03/ep178-nietzsche-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;episode 178 on &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/12/03/ep178-nietzsche-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Twilight of the Idols &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. Also, the talk of lopsided people is explored in more detail in N's &lt;em &gt;Thus Spake Zarathustra &lt;/em &gt;(see &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/04/15/ep213-nietzsche-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our eps. 213-214 &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally we talk about Nietzsche's perspectivism, as opposed to the "objectivity" that is really an aspect of asceticism: ignoring some things that we know to focus on particular abstract aspects. Instead, we need to use hermeneutics, which is the exploration of the meaning of phenomena, which is a much looser, more literary kind of analysis, which N. has given us an example of through the genealogical analysis that is the crux of this book, as well as the current interrogation of the meaning of asceticism. There is no abstract reasoning, but only actual people with their various biases doing their best to be objective, and there's no point in pretending otherwise. Is this really a fair criticism of actual scientists, or just a reaction to the Baconian, pretentious scientists of his day and the philosophers influenced by them, like Bentham trying to make a calculus of pains and pleasures?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks for being a PEL supporter. Next episode is on Lise van Boxel's &lt;em &gt;Warspeak &lt;/em &gt;, and you can prepare for that by &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/12/18/combat-classics-episode-50-warspeak-by-lise-van-boxel/" target="_blank"&gt;listening to the prior treatment of that book by Combat &amp;amp; Classics &lt;/a &gt;; in fact, both Michael and Jeff from that discussion will appear on PEL #263, filling in for both Mark and Wes. Where that discussion is about the book's project as a whole and asks some basic questions about Nietzsche's philosophy, we're reading the last two chapters which are specifically a reaction to the material in this third part of Nietzsche's &lt;em &gt;Genealogy &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Friedrich Nietzsche's &lt;em &gt;The Genealogy of Morals &lt;/em &gt;(1887), "Third essay: what do ascetic ideals mean?" featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When people really get &lt;em &gt;serious &lt;/em &gt;, and try to put away frivolous things, is that good or bad? A serious athlete will subordinate everything to their training, an artist may even forget to eat or sleep while crafting a work, and of course at the extreme, a religious mystic might completely withdraw from the world and its temptations to put their energy entirely on their connection to divinity. Nietzsche analyses these extreme behaviors as following from ascetic ideals. But while in these cases asceticism is most obvious, the ideal actually rules us all to varying degrees through the values that religion hands down to us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The civilization of the human animal amounts to the creation of a super-ego to tamp down on some parts of ourselves. For an artist or scholar or warrior, this self-denial is a matter of focusing on some activity that is seen as more important than the parts being repressed, and so Nietzsche finds this admirable. It's clearly a manifestation of our will to power, like sharpening yourself to a keen point to be more effective, even though doing so involved shaving off a lot of parts of yourself, i.e. not being well-rounded in a more healthy way. But self-denial can also be in favor of, well, nothing, a uniform quashing of the self in favor of some external ideal, as when one simply bows down to a king or god or idol, putting all value on that worshipped thing and none on oneself. This is clearly self-destructive, according to Nietzsche, but nonetheless also has its source in the will to power, because by bowing down and subordinating yourself to something you've elevated to the highest, you're now on its team, your will is now through it subordination one and the same as what you posit to be the most powerful force.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This episode is formally a sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-11-nietzsches-30313414" target="_blank"&gt;our long-ago episode 11 &lt;/a &gt;where we discussed the main thesis and first two essays of &lt;em &gt;The Genealogy &lt;/em &gt;, in the context of introducing meta-ethics, which is the question of where values come from and what makes them binding upon us. For Nietzsche (as for Locke), they come from our psychology (the will to power, for Nietzsche) and from social customs, which are influenced by psychology but which change dynamically over time. His &lt;em &gt;Genealogy &lt;/em &gt;gives a rough history of values: Originally, our values were roughly animal, prizing strength and self-expression: the will to power undiluted. Then with the rise of Judeo-Christian morality (and really, he could craft similar stories about the evolution of Eastern moralities), those animal, "master" values were turned on their head and against themselves, such that raw exertion of power was now labeled as "evil," and self-effacement, voluntarily (or otherwise) making oneself weak, was considered good. The book's second essay details how we develop "bad conscience" in light of such a "slave" morality, with the clear implication being that we need to overcome that self-denying system, not so much to go back to being an unrestrained animal, but to more wisely exert these newfound powers of introspection and self-control to create great philosophies and artworks and our own character.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The problem with the picture many readers take away from this reading of &lt;em &gt;The Genealogy &lt;/em &gt;is that it's too binary: Nietzsche has told the story of how the master morality's "good" and "bad" were switched around such that what was good is now called "evil" and what was bad is now called "good," and what that leaves us with is a clear call to new values that are more like the master morality. All those slavish priests should be condemned, and maybe those self-confident self-promoters should now be admired. Go seize the day and make your mark on the world! This third essay adds nuance to the picture: The ascetic ideal is a chief tool of the will to power. It of course must have been present in ancient Sparta with its rigorous warrior training, but it was greatly developed (according to Nietzsche) by priests as a sneaky way of turning their strength-denying ways into the dominant social, political, and moral force. Nietzsche is obviously in favor of philosophy, and art, and science as opposed to superstition, and all these practitioners use this tool of asceticism to define and defend their domains, so that philosophy becomes not mere speculation, art becomes not mere dabbling, and science acquires a rigorous methodology. Asceticism is in short professionalization for these areas.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So the same tool has both good and bad uses for Nietzsche. But we need to watch out: The single-mindedness that allows a writer to produce a great work also by its nature creates blind spots, and the chief one that Nietzsche focuses on in the end of his essay is one that we considered in our second foray into Nietzsche's work: ep. 61 on his unpublished early essay "&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-61-nietzsche-17045749" target="_blank"&gt;On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense &lt;/a &gt;." The blind spot is our faith in the pursuit of truth at all costs. We think of science and religion as opposed, but the scientist for Nietzsche has elevated "truth" into the spot that God used to hold and still acts religiously toward that object. Nietzsche wants us to extend the questioning involved in science (and philosophy, and yes, in art too) to this pursuit of truth (or beauty as a species of truth, in the case of the artist) itself. It's difficult to tell exactly what this means in practical terms, but in terms of attitude, it means pursuing science and philosophy cheerfully, with self-deprecating modesty, i.e. "gay science" (the subject or &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-84-netzsches-27526646" target="_blank"&gt;our third Nietzsche episode, #84 &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ultimately, awareness of our ascetic tendencies is I think meant to make us more well-rounded. Yes, be an extreme athlete or artist, or whatever you need to do to try to make your life great, but keep well-grounded in doing so; don't lose the larger perspective that you'll need if you break a leg or lose some artistic opportunity or capacity. Nietzsche uses the case of Wagner to show you what not to do and what one might do while aging. Nietzsche had admired the great world-building in Wagner's operas, but found &lt;em &gt;Parsifal &lt;/em &gt;to be sentimental Christian dreck. On Nietzsche's reading, Wagner basically scared himself and retreated to provincial morality as his way of getting serious, getting back to basics. Nietzsche suggests instead that if the weight of world-building is to heavy, Wagner should have instead jumped in his next work to a meta level, satirizing his creative process. This is the way the dialectic of creativity is supposed to work: You overcome what you've done in the past to create something new, whereas Nietzsche thought Wagner in creating &lt;em &gt;Parsifal &lt;/em &gt;was not overcoming but just retreating from his own greatness.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As with many of Nietzsche's critiques, this may seem a difference that is just a matter of opinion. Had Wagner created a satire of himself, this might also be seen as a self-rejecting retreat rather than a triumphant overcoming. To be generous to Wagner, I'd venture that only artists themselves can really say whether they're progressing or regressing along their idiosyncratic dialectical paths, even while we should acknowledge that self-knowledge is far from perfect, so there's a role for critics like Nietzsche in the process to help us see past our blind spots. This idea of a dialectical progression in self-comportment (including creativity, ethics, and pursuit of truth) was the foundation for Simone de Beauvoir's &lt;em &gt;The Ethics of Ambiguity &lt;/em &gt;, as discussed in &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/05/30/episode-140-1-beauvoir/" target="_blank"&gt;our episodes 140-141 &lt;/a &gt;. She condemns "the serious man" directed by the ascetic ideal, and also "the nihilist," which is just a serious person whose faith in his god has been destroyed. As Nietzsche says in the current book, we prefer to will nothingness than to not will at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Importantly, though, Beauvoir also rejects the next step in the dialectic, "the adventurer," which may be Nietzsche himself or at least a reasonable interpretation of this exhortation to "gay science." Such an adventurer will pour himself into an endeavor, but temporarily, and then move on to the next thing, which to Beauvoir betrays a shallowness as opposed to a real ethical engagement. So would Nietzsche condemn Beauvoir as in fact too traditional, too "serious," or does Nietzsche's own passion for writing and capturing the subtlety of philosophic truth show that he is no mere adventurer and in fact fulfills Beauvoir's ideal? Ultimately, if we're engaged in this inner struggle, then we've bought into Nietzsche and Beauvoir's program of self-development, which is probably all they could've really wanted from us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2MnzHGj" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://erikbuys.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/on-the-genealogy-of-morality-friedrich-nietzsche.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Picture by Genevieve Arnold.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on &lt;em &gt;Reasons and Persons &lt;/em &gt;(1984), ch. 10-13.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/01/18/ep261-1-parfit-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;where we left off &lt;/a &gt;, we consider more closely Bernard Williams' response to Parfit and how Parfit turns that argument back on itself. In defending physicalism against Lockean memory conceptions of personal identity, Williams presented a situation in which you're about to undergo some torture. I tell you that during this torture, I'll gradually flip switches that will change your memories and personality to those of Greta Garbo. When I'm done, you'll by the psychological criteria not be the same person at all. The question is, would you be frightened at this prospect, to the same degree that you'd be frightened at my threatening to just torture you, with no accompanying memory changes? Williams says yes: The fact that there'd be a continuous experience of pain means that it would still be you throughout, even with your memories and other psychological characteristics changing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Parfit responds by combining this thought experiment with the one described at the end of my part one write-up where your brain is gradually replaced by clone brain cells. Where in that thought experiment, the clone would have the same memories (and so was supposed to prove that consistent memory is enough to guarantee personal identity even in the absence of brain persistence), and in Williams' where brain stayed the same while memories changed (and so same brain is enough for personal identity even in the absence of memory connections), Parfit's combined thought experiment is that your brain cells are gradually replaced not with clone brain cells, but with clone brain cells of Greta Garbo's brain. So for sure at the end of the procedure, there will simply be a different person: different brain, and different memories too. Still, the all-or-nothing character of personal identity implies that there must be a strict cut-off point where the brain stops being you and starts being Greta Garbo, and Parfit claims that this doesn't make any sense.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Parfit's solution is reductionist: There are just the facts about brain and psychological continuity, and there is no further fact beyond those to whether two entities are identical. This amounts to getting rid of the concept of personal identity altogether, and its all-or-nothing character. The reductionist can admit the similarities and differences between the various stages in the last brain surgery example, but if asked about any two cases "is this person at stage A the same as the person at stage B?" they can just shrug and admit that the concept of personal identity was invented for social purposes to deal with typical cases, and isn't meant to extend to definitively decide any of these sci fic cases.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So that concept of personal identity is just not robust enough to answer, to give another example that we get into in this half of the discussion, whether a split-brained patient is really a single person with two streams of consciousness or two people coexisting in one brain. Dissociative Identity Disorder is a condition where a single human might have numerous distinct pockets of memory that interact to varying degrees: Are they all "the same person" or not? If a person were to split like an amoeba into two, so each new organism actually has the same physical brain (or half of it)--this is unlike the cloning case where one was a mere copy of the original with no brain continuity--would the new organisms be "the same person" as the original even though they're clearly not the same person as each other? Again, shrug.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What do you think? We'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below. Thanks for being a PEL supporter!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Oh, and we bring up the "re-souling" involved in the latest Wonder Woman film, which is considered in more detail in &lt;a href="https://prettymuchpop.com/2021/01/06/pmp76-wonder-woman/" target="_blank"&gt;Pretty Much Pop #76 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Reasons and Persons &lt;/em &gt;(1984), ch. 10-13, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes a person the same over time? Parfit used Locke as a starting point: It's a matter of continuity of memory: I am the same person as my younger self because there are overlapping chains of memory. Even if I and earlier me don't share any specific memories (Locke's actual criterion), there's a chain by which old me had a set of memories, then a day later lost some and gained some, and so on going forward to the present.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This reasonable sounding view has interesting consequences when you consider sci-fi examples: If someone makes a copy of your memories somehow, whether to teleport or to clone or to upload you to a computer simulation, then that copy would literally be you: You live on through the copy even if your original body is destroyed. However, identity is by definition a one-to-one relation: What if more than one copy is made? Are those copies and the original all 'the same person" even if they're now running around living independent lives and gaining new memories? They're all continuous, and so numerically identical, with the pre-copied self according to the theory, so by transitivity, they should all be identical to each other, but they're clearly not.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The main alternative theory is continuity of physical substance, specifically the brain, and Parfit thinks this option ("the physical criterion") is even worse. According to that theory, in the case of teleportation (where the original body is destroyed as a copy is put together at a remote location), you simply die. Yes, someone qualitatively identical to you ends up at the other end of the process, and it would think it was you and continue to pursue your projects and be a part of your human relationships, but it wouldn't really be you in the sense of numerical identity; the original brain was destroyed! Parfit's argument against this view uses a different sci-fi example: Imagine a brain surgeon is replacing small parts of your brain one by one with identical ones. The physicalist here is committed to the view that at the beginning and end of the process, it's a totally different person, because the entire brain has been replaced. It's also key to the notion of personal identity that two persons are either the same or they're not. There's no "sort of." Just as a continuous chain of memory constituted the view descended from Locke ("the psychological criteria"), a continuous chain of brain matter constitutes on the physicalist view the same person over time. Even if past-me and present-me don't have any of the same neurons, the replacement was gradual, so it's still me.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But this means there's a contradiction in the brain-surgery case. They physicalist has said no cloning, right? But the brain surgery is a gradual conversion of someone into their own clone, so the overlapping-chain character of this transformation should mean that either in this case, the clone really is still you, or at some point there was a change in personhood. But at what point? The concept of personal identity says that it's all or nothing: It can't be the case that cases in the middle are "sort of" the same. There must have been some middle point in which replacing a single neuron suddenly made you into a whole new person, but this seems implausible, for one because we could never figure out which exact point that was.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The third main view Parfit considered was the traditional religious one, best known to philosophers through Locke, that is really the source of this all-or-nothing logic, which is continuity of soul or spiritual substance. As Locke already argued, given that we can't actually sense such a soul, this seems problematic, because then how do we know that, for instance, our soul isn't being replaced every day? It's the memories, according to Locke, that are the sensible indicator of continuity of mind. If we consider the cloning and teleporting examples, then either the soul itself would have to be copied or split (what would this even mean?), or more likely, the soul sticks to one body and the copies would then be soulless, or have new souls? According to Parfit, we can't entirely rule out this view that personal identity is continuity of soul, but it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. If we had real evidence for it, like solid evidence of reincarnation whereby people can remember their past lives, then that would be good evidence that there really are souls that can attach to different bodies, and that they can carry psychological characteristics and constitute the real basis of personal identity, but we have no such credible evidence. Imagine how much easier it would be for archaeologists if past-life rememberers could direct them to the appropriate digging sites! But that has never happened.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Parfit's conclusion from considering all these views is that none of them work, that the notion of personal identity is incoherent. However, this doesn't lessen the importance of the question, for the person who's contemplating being teleported, "will I die?" According to Parfit, strictly speaking, yes, you will. However, the continued existence of your identical clone with all of your memories is &lt;em &gt;just as good &lt;/em &gt;as living on. Moreover, even during ordinary, day-to-day life, there's less continuity than we might think, and so more precisely, it's not that living on through your clone is just as good as ordinary persistence, but that ordinary persistence is &lt;em &gt;just as bad &lt;/em &gt;as being cloned. This conclusion is supposed to have Buddhist ethical implications. If personal identity is a concept that ultimately breaks down and is not really the thing that we're concerned with in our existential wonderings, then extreme selfishness doesn't make sense. You are not so intimately connected with future-you and past-you that these connections vastly outweigh your connections to other people. Your concern for future-you is not fundamentally different than your concern for the welfare of others. If clone-me continues my projects and relationships, that's pretty much all I want out of life anyway.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These are the main views considered, but there's much more detail to the arguments and many more sci-fi cases. You may want to &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3oXd2Pd" target="_blank"&gt;buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.stafforini.com/docs//Parfit%20-%20Reasons%20and%20persons.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The discussion continues in part two. We didn't get a lot of feedback re. whether supporters prefer the unified Citizen version or would rather have it cut up like this. Some podcast apps by default play the most recent episode first, which would mean part two starts playing, which is annoying. On the other hand, we had a supporter tell us that having them cut up (and of course given that the general public doesn't hear part two now, we're being more deliberate in how we cut it up; it doesn't just switch randomly in the middle) gives him more bite-sized pieces to deal with on separate days. The deciding factor right now is that newly arriving supporters who already listened to part one in its public form don't have to stumble around figuring out where in the Citizen version to start if we divide up the supporter versions, so it looks like we're going to keep doing it this way barring mass outcries from you all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;One last take on John Locke's &lt;em &gt;Essay Concerning Human Understanding &lt;/em &gt;(1689), covering Book II, ch. 21 and 28, featuring Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes a moral claim true? Do we have free will? What makes us choose the good, or not? In this coda to our long treatment of Locke's opus, we bring together all he has to say about morality, which is strangely modern yet also just strange.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We consider ch. 28 first, which is about moral semantics: If a speaker makes a moral claim, how do others judge it to be true or not? According to Locke, the moral claim is judged as true if it successfully matches whatever the mores of the society are. Moral ideas, you'll recall, are complex ideas (specifically mixed modes) putting together elements of reflection and sensation to describe human actions. So if I claim that an imagined action is generous, that description will be accurate if I'm using the word as it was invented correctly: Am I attributing it to an act of selfless giving, and not something that is actually stingy or on the other hand so excessive as to be nihilistic or back-handed self-praise ("I'm such a martyr!") So is Locke a cultural relativist, where "the good" is not a matter of relation to a natural quality but just just conformity to social norms? Not necessarily, but he's more interested in moral psychology (how we make moral decisions) than moral ontology (the facts about the world that ground these decisions as correct).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The conformity of a moral claim (or act) can be with various kinds of laws, and Locke identified three types: divine, civil, and opinion/reputation. As Locke established in book one, civil laws and mores (i.e. laws of opinion/reputation) will vary tremendously between cultures, which is why we're lucky to have the Bible (divine) to have made our laws and mores better than those of the heathens. However, just because God isn't an innate idea doesn't mean that His pronouncements don't especially accord with reason in a way that wise people of any culture couldn't figure them out, and even here in our enlightened land, we have to use our reason to figure out how to interpret Biblical laws so that they accord with human nature, which is the objective thing that ethical laws really need to be about: Nature has composed us to desire what we take to be to our benefit and avoid what isn't (with complications as described below), and this provides a potential basis for critiquing human laws and mores. However, we don't normally do this, as we're too worried about the sanctions that go with violating the laws. Locke's whole notion of law is tied inexorably to sanctions: We have to obey civil laws because we'll go to jail if we don't, and we obey the laws of reputation because of the sanction of being shunned. This a priori claim about laws consitutes an argument for Locke for why there must be divine reward and punishment; if there weren't such things, the whole idea of divine law wouldn't even make sense. (For a good response building on this, see &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/02/18/episode-88-anscombe/" target="_blank"&gt;our ep. 88 on Anscombe &lt;/a &gt;, who agrees that our moral language involves an inevitably theistic context but sees this as a problem; we need to drop the language of laws and turn instead explicitly to talk of human nature a la Aristotle).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The bulk of ch. 21 (the longest chapter in the whole book) gives Locke's version of &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/09/19/ep147-1-aristotle-incontinence/" target="_blank"&gt;Aristotle's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/09/19/ep147-1-aristotle-incontinence/" target="_blank"&gt;Nicomachean Ethics &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, building on the ideas about pain and pleasure as pervasive motivators in our experience to explore questions like why people often react to a present uneasiness while neglecting a greater available good. In keeping with the divine thoughts above, the chapter ends a la Pascal by excoriating us not to neglect the good of eternal paradise in favor of an immediate, apparent good.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is in the context of a discussion of free will that reveals Locke as one of the first modern compatibilists. On the one hand, we do react in predictable ways: We react to painful and pleasurable stimuli. However, there are clearly cases where on the one hand we're simply carried along automatically and others where we stop and deliberate, and that's what liberty consists in. "Free will" is actually a misnomer according to Locke, because it's agents (people) who are free, not the "will," which is a power we have to choose. Locke was very wary of faculty psychology that makes us into a multiplicity of pseudo-agents. For a person to be free is for that person to be able to execute what they will, so if you're constrained either by external circumstance or by your own passions (which make you passive, by definition), then you're not free. People are free, unlike animals, insofar as they can forbear acting think about what they REALLY want. Can you control what it is you want, what it is you will? Can you simply not will all? These are questions that Locke had no patience for; it's in the nature of human motivation to desire according to what gives us pleasure of any sort, and more importantly, to want to avoid whatever gives us pain or even makes us uneasy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This account comes in the context of a discussion of what power is. It was already identified (in our ep. 258) as being a simple idea, and we try to figure out how that could be and how we acquire the idea. On the one hand, in perceiving a simple idea like color or shape, we're also perceiving that there's something in the world fit to deliver up the relevant simple idea to us. This process as a whole doesn't sound so simple even if the resulting sensation (e.g. a green qualia) is simple. Power is also a relation we perceive between phenomena in the world, i.e. causality as discussed in ep. 259, where we debated whether a relation is complex (because it involves both relata) or simple (because a simple idea can connect two other, independent ideas). &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The real origin of this idea of power according to Locke is in our own internal willing: I will that I think of an elephant and BAM! I've thought of an elephant. From this primary reflective experience, we get the simple idea of power, which I then apply in all these other cases to do science (investigate causality) and come up with things like the primary/secondary quality distinction (different ways in which things in the world exert their powers to bring about ideas in me). Moreover, this perception of my own agency is the only really authentic case of power I can witness, because it's me as an active agent bringing about a result, whereas when I see (as goes the classic example) one billiard ball hitting another, I'm really just seeing one passive object transmit its momentum to another.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on Dec. 22, 2020 after our final Locke recording, this is our extra-long year-end edition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Granted, a lot of what we ALWAYS do in Nightcap is talk about what we might want to read in the future, and we really don't plan specifically more than a few episodes ahead, but here we lay out at least how we're feeling right now about how things might go in the coming year: more metaphysics, probably less politics, but maybe some more on rationality if we can figure out what's best to read.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start out with some listener emails: Will studying more philosophy crimp your science career or other development of day-job skills? Why are people so irrational when it comes to politics? The latter question leads us to not so much diagnose society's ills in this day and age as to situate ourselves with regard to what we might or might not want to study in regard to them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks for your support through 2020. Let's knock 'em dead (figuratively) in the new year!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Book II (ch. 22-33) of John Locke's &lt;em &gt;Essay Concerning Human Understanding &lt;/em &gt;(1689), discussed by Mark, Wes, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Simple ideas (as discussed in ep. 258) get complex rather quickly, perhaps as soon as you put them into words, and certainly as soon as you put them into a system. If I perceive the color blue, or a passing thought in my mind, a simple idea of this appears in my mind. If I then put it in the category "blue," so connecting it to lots of past experiences of blue; or if I recognize my thought as a "recollection," as opposed to a present perception or act of imagination, well, then those become complex ideas that Locke calls "modes." So there's the idea of something's being colored at all, then there's the particular modes of color: blue, green, yellow, etc.; there's the idea of thought, then there are specific modes of thought, of which recollection is one.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Some modes like blue and recollection are simple modes (even though, as we said, they're complex ideas), and they remain simple modes even when we add more of that idea to them. I can experience a certain distance--a centimeter--and then add centimeters together to make longer distances, even imagining distances longer than I could possibly detect with my senses. Those are all the same simple mode, i.e. distance.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Many of our complex ideas, however, are mixed modes, meaning they add elements from different ideas, and these include most actions you might observe in the world. While "movement" is a simple mode, "jogging" is a mixed mode, because it's not just something moving, but it also involves an intention; it's got elements from both perception and reflection in there. (Technically, contra to what we say on the podcast, all you need for a mixed mode is more than one idea involved; they don’t HAVE to be drawn from the different realms of inner and outer. However, it’s very hard to think of one that doesn’t involve both.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;All of these modes, no matter how complex, can be analyzed into component simple ideas. In this sense, they're free of philosophical confusion. It's only when you name them that you get things wrong: you call "green" what's really blue or call "jogging" what's really fleeing. Locke outlines several criteria for an idea's being legit: Is it clear? Distinct? Is it real or merely fantastical? Jogging is real, but centaur is fantastical, because I never did perceive such a conjunction of simple ideas. Is it adequate or inadequate? This is asking whether the idea in our heads captures all the there is to the thing referred to. Green and jogging and even justice (another mixed mode) are all adequate, because the mind (maybe not your mind, but somebody's mind) built them out of simple ideas. Is the idea true or false? Technically, only judgments are true and false, but some ideas imply judgments, so if the idea of a centaur is taken to be a claim that there are centaurs existing in the world, then that idea is false.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If I analyze a whole perceptual experience, Locke says that the elements in it will be modes and substances. I see a dog, and its modes (technically they're not the modes of the dog itself, but the modes in my head; we're talking about ideas, not doing metaphysics) include its color, its shape, its size, its texture, its movement: all of its properties, including the adjectives, verbs, and adverbs that apply to it. But what is it that has all these properties and is doing all these things? It's the substance: that dog.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what about these "substance" ideas? Locke says that they're inadequate: we don't really know what we're talking about. We know about animal's sensory properties (its modes) but we don't know what binds those properties together; we don't know the dog's inner nature. So Aristotelian philosophers are on shaky ground when they make "substance" a fundamental thing in their metaphysics or think that they can then know the "essence" of dog.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This has more implications than just letting Locke jeer at his Scholastic colleagues. For instance, Locke doesn't share Descartes' mind-body problem. Just like we don't understand what a material substance really is (it's just a SOMETHING that underlies and unites various modes), we don't understand a spiritual substance either (it's presumably just something that unifies all my thoughts, making them mine). Since these are both inadequate ideas, we're not justified in theorizing anything much about them: they may well somehow BE one and the same thing, or may run in parallel per Leibniz, or may be connected in a secret way per Descartes, but in any case, this knowledge is beyond human capabilities, so we should just shut up and stop worrying about it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Locke has a similar response to other philosophical problems. What, really, is cause and effect? Locke thinks that power is a simple idea. As I said, even just perceiving a color is to perceive that there's something that had the power to induce that color idea in me. Cause and effect is just a relation of this sort of power: two things are connected such that one has the power to produce an effect in the other. What is power REALLY? What unites these two elements, cause and effect? There's no further answer available to our limited minds according to Locke. Just shut up and do science!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is the universe infinite? Well, even though I said we can build longer space (and time) units in our minds out of what we perceive, we have no way to tell whether these ideas are real or fantastical. We don't really have an adequate idea of infinity at all, because we can't distinctly imagine it. The same goes for whether time or the chain of causation goes back infinitely or terminates in a first cause; we have no way of knowing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What are the smallest particles of the universe? Again, we can imagine spitting and splitting on indefinitely, but have no distinct ideas of the smallest possible particles. An "atom" (meaning not what scientists call atoms now, but whatever is the very smallest particle) may or may not exist just like a centaur may or may not exist (though we're pretty sure we made centaurs up).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we consider personal identity (our topic for ep. 261 after we're all done with Locke). For Locke, personal identity can't consist in having the same soul over time, if soul means spiritual substance. For all we know, God may swap out our soul every morning; we'd have no way of telling. It has to lie in something we actually perceive, and Locke identifies this as continuity of memory.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what about amnesia? Would I really be a different person? Yes and no. For Locke, yes, I'd be a different person, but not a different "man," since the latter is more like the same animal or plant and has to do with continuity of organism. An acorn can be the same plant as the oak it grows into, and so a fetus is the same "man" as the adult. If somehow by magic, Locke's consciousness was moved into his pet dog, then the new Locke-dog would consider himself the same person (he's still Locke, just in dog form), but we wouldn't consider this dog "the same man" as the old Locke. Clearly these words evolve for practical purposes, and there may just not be an answer on Locke's view to novel puzzles of personal identity, like if my brain patterns are copied into a computer, will that still be me? If there's continuity of memory, this sounds like the Locke-dog example, meaning the computer becomes me in a new location, but what if ALSO I don't die right away, so there's both the digital me and the meat me sticking around? I don't think Locke is going to have an answer in that case; our concepts are only as robust as the scope of their use.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on Nov. 30 after Locke II, we try a new format for this Nightcap: Relevantly to our current series on Locke, we re-listened to our first visit with the learned gentleman back in 2011: &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/05/06/ep37-locke-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Ep. 37 on his Second Treatise on Government &lt;/a &gt;(1690).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth couldn't join us for this one, but that's OK, because he was on that original episode, whereas Wes and Dylan were not, so here they and Mark reflect back on that old episode and apply some of its thinking to current political trends: Can we have a society run by reason and law, or are these supposedly objective terms actually just interpreted by those in power to advance their own ends, and in fact used as weapons of oppression? If post-structuralists are right that reason is a social construction, then we can't actually create a knave-proof system as the American founders envisaged, and we really do have to rely on the wisdom of the people to consistently elect good people or else give up on democracy altogether (in favor of what?).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So take a listen to his as a prelude to returning to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/05/06/ep37-locke-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 37 &lt;/a &gt;and trying to connect what he says there to his comments about epistemology. That was, at least, our plan, but it ended up being pretty difficult given how little we'd gotten into the &lt;em &gt;Essay &lt;/em &gt;as of the second episode in our series. Since recording this, we've done one more which will help to make the divide less wide, but it's easier to say in the abstract what makes a complex idea potentially shaky and actually applying that to what Locke or anyone else has to say about natural rights, because the truth is we don't and probably shouldn't try to break down our complex ideas into those simple ones gained from perception and reflection. Thinking that doing so can prove to be a test of that complex idea's adequacy seems overly optimistic, as it's too easy to rig an ad hoc explanation for your favorite political, religious, or social idea that supposedly links it to actual observations, and I don't know that any such explanations are particularly convincing. Perhaps Locke's political ideas need to rise or fall on their own merits, i.e. their applicability to to real-world conflicts rather than the pedigree of their component source ideas.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Book II (through ch. 20) of John Locke's &lt;em &gt;Essay Concerning Human Understanding &lt;/em &gt;(1689), discussed by Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In ep. 257, we established that Locke didn't think we are born with any actual knowledge; we only have as the raw materials of knowledge what our five senses feed us. But there do seem to be some beliefs about, for instance, the existence of our thoughts (Descartes' "cogito") that we certainly don't get from sensation. Locke's solution is to say that perception is not just of the outside world, but involves both sensation and reflection. In fact, every perception is conscious, and so includes knowledge that you're perceiving something. This goes for animals like dogs too, meaning that you don't need to know words like "perceiving" or "knowledge" to in fact have this awareness of yourself as perceiving.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So there are simple ideas like "circular" or "white" or "thinking" that we get straight from perception, and then there are complex ideas like "sphere" or "human" or "democracy" which require more work for us to put together, but of course what complicates things is that if I contemplate a person or globe or whatever, I actually perceive it as a person or globe, as belonging to those general categories, as having (for people) human nature, though I might not have a clear idea about what that entails. So if we're doing phenomenology (i.e. trying to look honestly at our experience as we're having it, which is what Locke does), then perception seems to be delivering up complex ideas, not just simple ones. We have to analyze our experience to separate out, for instance, how I recognize that something is a sphere, and so why I might be mistaken, as when I see a globe in a film, which is not really spherical, but merely the two-dimensional image of a sphere. What my senses are really delivering to me are colors, separated with appropriate shading that, given my experience seeing globes in the real world, makes me see that screen image as spherical. Locke didn't see it as problematic to set aside these incursions of our judgment and get and what simple ideas our perceptions are delivering to us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Now this type of analysis isn't just something the philosopher does in writing a book like this; it's what we all do as a precondition for developing an articulable concept like "white" or "spatial." Even to recognize a color as similar enough to one you've seen before to count as "the same color," you have to use memory and compare your current experience to a past one, which for Locke means you're actually recreating the old experience within your current consciousness. You can't just, like, look at some place in the back of your mind where the "white" file hangs out, because memorized information is stored, yes, in the brain, but not in the mind, which Locke defines as conscious experience itself. When you're not actually thinking of something, it's simply not in the mind at all. However, the mind (hopefully) has the capacity to find it again (we know not how; this is not something experience itself tells us any more than it tells us how our eyes and nerves and brain convert light waves to visual experiences) and create a new experience of remembering that enables the comparison. All this must be happening very quickly, because we identify objects as belonging to categories all the time without any apparent break for reverie about all the instances of white (or sphere, or whatever) you've run across before.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One of the confusing things about Locke's account is that ideas are all that are in the mind. This means that the raw material delivered by the senses are ideas (he doesn't use the term "sense data," which was an invention of later empiricists), and then we compare them with memories (also ideas, as is the act of comparing that we notice through reflecting on this experience), and then we relate the current and past experiences together in a single concept, which is also an idea, and in fact Locke called colors and shapes simple ideas even though I'm now saying that they must be general concepts built out of multiple, singular experiences (color "qualia," another useful term that Locke didn't have access to).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second half of our discussion, we get into more of the specific simple ideas that Locke thought that we acquire. First, pain and pleasure, which are not so much just those sensory feelings as any sense of welcome or uneasiness that accompanies virtually any thought we may have. Maybe he's thinking like Epicurus that these more subtle experiences always cash into vivid, physical pains and pleasures, but I don't think so; this is too important in Locke's theory of human motivation and ultimately ethics. Even something like curiosity, which causes us to look at one thing rather than another, is a matter for Locke of the pleasure which hangs on certain perceptions and the (relative) aversion attached to others. Without these prompts, we'd have no motivation to do anything at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Pain and pleasure also serve as great pre-cursors to considering primary vs. secondary qualities, the distinction for which Locke is perhaps most famous. We don't think just because fire causes pain in us that it's a painful thing, that the pain is in any sense in the fire. What we learn from being burnt is that fire is the kind of thing that can cause that sensation in us (along with blackening our fingers, making our eyes water, etc.). We're learning about some power that the fire has. Well, think about perception like this. When we perceive something, what we're really learning is that the thing has the power to cause such perceptions in us. Locke then wants to move beyond this to do some metaphysics, and posits that in the case of some sensory ideas, like color, the color itself is not in the causal object any more than pain is. Fire is not yellow or red; it merely has the power to cause those sensations in us. We can as shorthand call the fire "yellow," but Locke called that a matter of convenience; the color should be considered a "secondary quality" of the fire.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, Locke's theory has a different story when it comes to qualities like shape, or size, or motion. Those qualities, Locke thought, are actually in the objects themselves. How do we know this? Well, for one, we can get the ideas of them from more than one sense: I both see shape, but can also feel it (and if I could echolocate, I could perhaps hear it). And what in the object causes my perception of color? Fine details in its texture, i.e. in its shape. Even if there were no perceivers, according to Locke's theory, there would still be shapes and motions, but not any colors, sounds, or tastes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This was a point that subsequent empiricists disagreed with, on skeptical grounds: If we only have knowledge because of sensation and reflection, how do we know that there are shapes out in the world? Locke's treatment of the metaphysics of substance (which is what we'd need to answer this objection) doesn't co me until the second half of book II, so we'll come back to this in our next episode.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what about time? According to Locke, we get the idea of time not through our senses, but through reflection on the passage of our ideas. In fact, we don't even need to perceive motion or change out in the world. We first get the idea of duration through a reflective experience on one of our ideas passing away, replaced by another, etc. This is a fundamental structure of our experience that even a fetus would have. We need this idea of duration in order to make sense of movement that we subsequently witness out in the world. We further abstract from duration by cutting it into equal pieces by comparing it to recurring things like sunrise, and from there we get time as cut into measured units. This is all very different from the account of a subsequent phenomenologist like Henri Bergson, but we debate a little whether Locke actually had a view of experience as atomistic (this does seem to be implied by his use of ideas as the individual elements in the mind) or whether this idea of duration is of a flow which we then subsequently carve up.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on Nov. 13 after our first Locke recording (so we're back in sync!), we talk a little more about Locke's overall purpose and use this to respond to listener criticisms about the "spin" of various episodes and whether we should have guests on just to make sure that de rigueur attitudes are reflected.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Should we talk about politics? It looks like we'll have an end-of-the-year purposely public Nightcap to look back at shitty 2020 and being philosophically connected in a meme-driven political world. We do a little post-election ranting here.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Should one of us commit a major crime to raise the profile of the podcast? Probably not, and it probably wouldn't work anyway.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What about the practice of philosophical journaling? Is it worth reading the philosophical journals of famous philosophers and seeing their first drafts?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Book I of John Locke's &lt;em &gt;Essay Concerning Human Understanding &lt;/em &gt;(1689), discussed by Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How do we know things? Locke is well known as a British empiricist: All knowledge must ultimately come from our experience. Contra &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-18-plato-what-11380493"&gt;Plato &lt;/a &gt;, who thought that knowledge of the important things is "recollected," perhaps from the time before we were born as individual humans, when we were part of the absolute, true world. Well, there's a big jump between those two views, and we've never on this podcast systematically considered what views the empiricists were really arguing immediately against.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;An allegedly innate idea is one we're born with, that we therefore don't have to learn from experience. It's not important to tell a story like Plato's of &lt;em &gt;how &lt;/em &gt;exactly we can before birth to gain this knowledge, but the general presumption among Locke's opponents is that God made us and inscribed within us certain ideas or truths. One candidate supported by Descartes among others is that the idea of God Himself is innate. Otherwise (say these philosophers), how could we have learned that He exists? A strict empiricist is going to have trouble with this, because we don't sense God (not in the verifiable way we sense objects in the world, in any case), and it doesn't seem like the notion "God" can (like "shape") be abstracted from the things we experience, so therefore it can't be something we have a legitimate idea about at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Locke is going to say we need revelation to fill in the gaps of experience, but that's just a presumption and not something he argues in this part of the text. I'm just trying to motivate his "rationalist" opponents. Relatedly, some of these philosophers claim that the notion of "infinity" must be innate, and likewise all the basic axioms of geometry and arithmetic, even the concepts of number and spatiality themselves. One that Locke discusses a lot is the law of non-contradiction: Can something both be and not be at the same time?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the first half of our discussion here, we get very hung up on just formulating the notion of an "idea" according to Locke (and presumably those he's responding to). Ideas are whatever it is that's "inside" our minds, the things that the operations of though are directed at. Even this much is tricky, because clearly Locke has in mind the same thing that Descartes was talking about in noticing that he was thinking, and that this thought characterizes the mind. But I just said (as we say in the podcast) that the ideas are what the operations, i.e. the thinking, is directed at. If I'm perceiving or remembering my copy of Locke's book, then there's something I'm thinking of. If you see the mind as essentially a container, then the thing I'm thinking of is an idea: an image of this book as it was noticed by by senses and compared in my mind to other books (thus categorizing it as "book"), with a bunch of other mental associations that enrich this particular idea. It's also a compound idea, in that I can think of the book's contents (which could be, e.g. displayed on my computer screen or in other physical copies) vs. the actual physical instantiation, and within the latter I can think about the physical form being made up of its solidity, its colors, the texture of the pages, and lots of other qualities.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So these are all ideas, some simple, some compound (we'll explicitly consider the difference between those in episode 258), and many ideas can be put in the form of sentences. So there's the solidity of the book and also the idea expressed by "this book is solid." Locke very quickly goes from talking about innate ideas to innate principles. So it's not just the "idea" of non-contradiction (which is a little hard to imagine), but the actual claim that's used to articulate that idea, which is the principle of non-contradiction. This can be stated in a few different ways: A thing can't both be and not be at the same time. A claim can't both be true and false (at the same time and in the same respect). A single thing can't be in two different places at the same time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another example Locke considered is "God ought to be worshipped." Is this part of the mere idea of God or not? If you have a traditional conception of God, then yes; it's related just like those various versions of non-contradiction. Teasing out the principles is a way of seeing that you actually understand the core idea. So there's the core idea of numbers, and then there's all the arithmetic truths; the core idea of space and all the resultant truths of geometry.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So again, the realm of the mind is made up of these ideas, and one example of thinking about them is to cash them out into principles: Is the "cashing out," i.e. the thinking itself, also part of the mental? Locke says yes. Contra Freud, Locke (like Descartes) thought that all thinking must be conscious. If you think of something, you're also aware that you're thinking of it, so the idea of "thinking" is itself something we experience. It's not "perceived" per se, since that word is reserved for what comes in through our senses, but it's something we're exposed to immediately by reflection on our own minds. So mind is the thoughts but also the thinking, and both of these are transparent to us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is important, because clearly, we're born with numerous instincts. We already know how to breathe. But do any of these capacities amount to knowledge? We &lt;em &gt;know how &lt;/em &gt;to do things, but according to Locke, we don't &lt;em &gt;know that &lt;/em &gt;anything is or isn't the case. Even something like "I am breathing" is something that you'd learn just by observing yourself doing it, just like "I am thinking."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to a secondary source we all read on this part of Locke's book, Locke's opponents can be divided into occurrent nativists and dispositional nativists. You'll notice that in my description of Locke's take on the mind, there isn't room for, for instance, a stored memory to be classified as mental. To be in the mind, an idea has to be something you're actually thinking. So memories aren't mental, except insofar as they &lt;em &gt;were &lt;/em &gt;mental (you at some point thought about or perceived the thing) and if you remember them accurately, you can have a new mental experience recollecting the thing. But despite what I just said about the "thinking" actually being part of the mental, it's clear there must be a lot of "processing" that's happening that Locke does not consider part of thinking, like however it is that memories get stored in the brain and retained, or perhaps not.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The upshot is that occurrent nativism is a hard position to defend, and that's the position that Locke spent most of his energy arguing against. If you want to claim that something like the law of non-contradiction is innate, as an occurrent nativist you'd have to claim that every human being is actually thinking, or at least has actually thought, of that idea. Locke pointed out that of course babies and "idiots" haven't actually thought this thought, that it takes education. Much less "God," which plenty of cultures (Buddhists?) don't believe in and don't even think of that term as Westerners do. Another allegedly innate principle is the golden rule: you ought not to do to others what you don't want done to you. Yet many cultures, Locke claimed, not only don't affirm this, but they positively condone practices like infanticide (You don't like your baby? Leave it out to die of exposure!), and feel no guilt about it. Clearly those people are not constantly thinking about the golden rule, and if it has crossed their minds, well, then the opposite (or rather this particular exception) has crossed their minds more often. They can't be said to "know" it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The more sophisticated position (which Descartes for one believes in) is dispositional nativism. It's not that everyone can recite our inborn principles, but everyone can (as in the case of the slave boy in Plato's &lt;em &gt;Meno &lt;/em &gt;) be brought to see that they already knew them, just implicitly. Locke saw this as also problematic. First, the argument against universal assent described above still applies here: Those infanticide-loving cultures and atheistic cultures aren't going to assent in any circumstances to the supposedly universal, innate principles against infanticide and for belief in God. But let's just consider the less controversial, more theoretical cases like non-contradiction, space, and number. Perhaps people will all assent to these upon gaining the ability to reason? So (per the appellation "rationalist") it's reason that shows us that we knew these things all along?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Locke argued that first, there are plenty of people that can reason, but still haven't formulated the law of non-contradiction. Also, the fact that something seems obviously true as soon as we understand it doesn't prove that it's inborn. There are plenty of truths of experience that this applies to, like "dogs are different from cats." As soon as you understand what each of these animal types is, you understand that they're different, but of course you only know these from perceiving (or being told about) them. No one is claiming that they're innate truths. Locke just didn't see any way to formulate criteria for determining innate truths that wouldn't also apply to obviously empirical truths. We first learn, from experience, things like "red isn't yellow" and "dogs aren't cats," and then use reason to generalize to truths like "a point can't be two colors at once" and "no animal can be both dog and cat," and then if we're educated or thoughtful enough, we'll get to "something can't be what it is not" or other formulations of the principle of non-contradiction.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Locke's arguments against the dispositional nativist are considered much less successful than those against the occurrent nativist, but they come down to trying to deny that we could possibly figure out what truths we have the disposition to believe without us actually thinking those truths at some time or other, i.e. that all dispositional nativists are really occurrent ones. Plato, in describing some time before birth where we knew all the truths of the Forms, at least gives us an image whereby these thoughts did actually occur to us, but then we forgot. If you abandon that myth in favor of some truths being instinctual or otherwise programmed into us by God, then it's hard to prove that we all actually believe such truths unless we show evidence of this by uttering them in appropriate circumstances, and Locke didn't believe that we all do this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2HtsPoo" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or read it online.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on Oct. 22 (post Sun Tzu, pre Kropotkin), we start off with a possible new segment: Verbal Correctness Corner. What words are we using wrong, are we pronouncing them correctly, are we transliterating foreign names and words correctly? Mark is the only one who enjoys this segment, so maybe it'll be a one-time thing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then move to email: Should you go to school for philosophy? Or otherwise follow a dream? Should you have kids?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We conclude by talking about our note-taking practices and the practice of tracking marginalia and notes by famous philosophers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-dark-side-of-meritocracy-review-of-the-tyranny-of-merit" target="_blank"&gt;Read Wes' review of Sandel's book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on Peter Kropotkin's &lt;em &gt;The Conquest of Bread &lt;/em &gt;(1892). &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/43690201"&gt;Start with Part One &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If Kropotkin is right that mutual aid is a natural tendency and so communism is very much feasible, why hasn't it happened already? This is the question that he starts off with in his Preface (added in 1913), and we go through this and many other specific points and passages from the text. Also, where does religion fit into Bakunin's picture? What exactly are the limits on expropriation; is there any room for private property of personal items, and if not, doesn't that somehow impinge on our individual integrity?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk a lot about Kropotkin's version on Obama's "You didn't build that" objection: Even if you produce something with your own labor and so think of it as yours, probably you used tools, and produced it in an environment relatively free of hazards, and learned how to make via education... All these things mean that others' labor went indirectly into your product as well, and so it is really part of our common heritage. Does that mean that "we" can take it from you and give it to someone more needy? Well, there isn't really a "we," is there? There's no government, so it's just a matter of the subtleties of moral norms. If you already have a lot of the thing and others are needy, it is right for you to give it away, and others will also recognize that and exert social (but not military) pressure on you to do the right thing. If it's an extremely scarce thing, like a medicine that someone else needs to survive, yes, maybe we the rest of the people could and should take it out of your hands if you're hoarding it. But under ordinary circumstances, and by default, you'd have total control over your creations, given that no one (like a landlord or king or state government) is in a position to reallocate it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Other topics: Guaranteed minimum income, various identities we might have instead of government-based national identities, meeting higher than just material needs, whether we would all want to contribute to doing manual work, and the anarchist philosophical project. Can we have organizations to settle, e.g. questions of justice, that are less acute than the state, i.e. they can't jail us?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Peter Kropotkin's &lt;em &gt;The Conquest of Bread &lt;/em &gt;(1892), discussed by Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If we want an egalitarian society, do we need the state to accomplish this? Kropotkin says no, that in fact the state inevitably serves the interests of the few, and that if we got rid of it, our natural tendencies to cooperate would allow us through voluntary organizations to keep everyone not only fed and clothed, but able to vigorously pursue callings like science and art.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kropotkin was born a Russian prince, became a geographer and so traveled a lot and became interested in the peasantry, and so rejected his birthright and became an anarchist, leading to his being jailed and having to flee (first Russia, then the same thing happened in France). He wrote this in England with intense historical reflection on three failed peasant revolutions in France: in 1789, 1848, and 1870. In each of these cases, the fighting caused the economy to break down (as one would expect), and the revolutionary leaders failed to mobilize everyone to feed the people. The people then welcomed reactionary crack-down.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The only solution for Kropotkin is for the revolutionary party to, instead of trying to cement themselves as the leaders of a new society, use their fleeting power to direct the people to self-organize: To take stock of what the current supplies are and immediately distribute them so that people are fed and clothed while they then figure out how to organize themselves to get the factories and farms and markets running again. Kropotkin (like right-wing, free-market anarchists such as &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/10/27/ep104-nozick-libertarianism/" target="_blank"&gt;Nozick &lt;/a &gt;) thought that in normal circumstances, the government really doesn't touch a lot of ordinary interaction, that it's not in a good position to perform central economic planning (see &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/09/07/ep123-1-economics/" target="_blank"&gt;Hayek &lt;/a &gt;), and even the basic promise-keeping required by commerce is not something that government able to effectively enforce. We can have a fully functioning economy, he thinks, without the state.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The two main functions the state serves in our current economic system are enforcing private property rights and (increasingly in modern times) preventing abuse of workers. Kropotkin in fact thinks that the state is ALL about keeping property in the hands of its current owners, and that's a main reason why the state should go. Because he thinks mutual aid is a natural telos for human behavior (and animal behavior within a species for that matter; he's got a whole &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution" target="_blank"&gt;separate book &lt;/a &gt;on this), government's enforcement of property rights perverts human nature and gives rise to the abuses capitalists make on workers. If everyone were already taken care of through the abundance of our riches--Kropotkin thinks that scarcity of basic goods is not an issue, that it's just manufactured by capitalists who want to maximize profits--then there'd be no motivation to abuse workers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So if we were all taken care of, wouldn't laziness rule the day, and everyone would just take as much of the public stock as they could and contribute nothing? No, says Kropotkin: People want to help themselves and each other. If they can grow crops and directly benefit from 100% of that instead of having a landowner take most of it, they'll be all the more motivated. And because there's plenty for everyone, there'll be no motivation for them to hoard their surplus; they'll share it (and in effect trade it, because others will also share) around.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is this position naïve, about human nature but also about our capacities to self-organize? Kropotkin points to very complex agreements between companies (e.g. to build the railroads in Europe, or the Red Cross) that were able to accomplish mighty feats without some king or other government giving the orders. No doubt today he'd point also to open-source tech collaborations like Wikipedia, universities, scientific societies, and industry groups. The question is, can business get done on a mass scale without a profit motive or government regulation? Given how much both of these lie at the root of our own society, it's difficult for us to envision how this might be possible, but Kropotkin is just going to say that we've been blinded by the dogma of statism (which as I've said, is also the dogma of private property).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Another historical note: After this text was written, the Russian Revolution occurred, and at that point Kropotkin moved back to Russia where he as revered as a great thinker. However, he was as you'd expect very critical of the Leninist system which was of course a strong central government, and shortly after he died, there was a purge in the country of anarchists of his stripe. I mention this largely because any kind of anti-capitalist stance is inevitably interpreted by right-wingers as leading to totalitarianism: Thinking outside of the current system is "utopian," and the only way to bring about a utopia is to force people into it, whether directly a la &lt;em &gt;1984 &lt;/em &gt;or through conditioning a la &lt;em &gt;Brave New World &lt;/em &gt;. But the anarchists' disagreement with Karl Marx lies in the latter's claim that before we can get to a free, communist society, we have to go through a period of socialist state. The anarchist's refusal of government is a refusal of any possibility of totalitarianism, unless one takes the latter term in the manner of current right-wing pundits against non-governmental ways of enforcing social norms.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If government withers away, then we have to rely more than we do now on traditions, on public ethics, or moral censure of people directly by other people. That's what's going to keep people from hoarding or being lazy or otherwise undermining the common good. One might object that this kind of control of people by others can be even more invasive and insidious than having laws on the books meant to prevent abuse, and Kropotkin in this text doesn't go into topics like criminal justice. In some past episode (&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/08/01/ep144-1-nussbaum/" target="_blank"&gt;Nussbaum?&lt;/a &gt;) we discussed how with the onset of the state, the private revenge motive becomes impersonal, i.e. becomes justice (this was illustrated through consideration of the final part of Aeschylus' &lt;em &gt;Oresteia &lt;/em &gt;: &lt;em &gt;The Eumenides &lt;/em &gt;, i.e. the "Kindly Ones" that the Furies are converted into). If we reverse that transition, would we then have mob rule instead of the rule of law? Even with the lack of a profit motive, isn't it very possible that we'd have "voluntary associations" that end up bullying each other, like the social groups that form in prisons?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kropotkin is expressly not giving us a panacea, not shooting for utopia, and in fact thinks that it's the liberal statist who's shooting for something essentially unrealistic: a government that is truly representative of the people and cares about its interests. Again, as soon as some people are in charge, with violence at their disposal to enforce their will, then they will inevitably structure society to serve their interests (and "interests" will have a very clear meaning given current property norms that Kropotkin wants to abolish). This is perhaps the response to the "gang" objection above: Such gangs would be governments, and so anarchism forbids them. But then, again, how does the "forbidding" work in practice? For Kropotkin, it needs to be a matter of each person's utter freedom to self-determination. You've probably heard the saying "What if they had a war and nobody came?" This is Kropotkin's way of heading off conflict scenarios like this. With no profit motive, with no rule of one person over another, with real recognition of our unity as a species, there's simply no motivation for serious (deathly) conflict.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One issue that we didn't go into was whether this communitarian attitude requires some common cultural background. The advantage of a liberal society a la &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/12/07/episode-85-rawls-on-social-justice/" target="_blank"&gt;Rawls &lt;/a &gt;is that it admits of pluralistic takes on the good. Our discussion with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/02/10/ep209-francis-fukuyama-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Francis Fukuyama &lt;/a &gt;explored the idea that for solidarity, you might need to have some cultural cohesion (a possible rationale for putting limits on immigration, if you're looking for such a thing). Some comments Kropotkin makes sound a little too much like the fascist seeds we might attribute to Heidegger's talk of the "volk." From chapter 9 (p. 104) of the book, here's a Kropotkin quote:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;blockquote &gt;&lt;p &gt;today the united city has ceased to exist; there is no more communion of ideas. The town is a chance agglomeration of people who do not know one another, who have no common interest, save that of enriching themselves at the expense of one another. The fatherland does not exist . . . What fatherland can the international banker and the rag-picker have in common? Only when cities, territories, nations, or groups of nations, will have renewed their harmonious &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/blockquote &gt;&lt;p &gt;So you could take this as expressing something like Sandel's mourning that we need settings to develop solidarity between rich and poor (as opposed to the rich being able to buy their way out of any environment where they might have to brush elbows with the hoi polloi), but I should stress that Kropotkin's setting for revolution and egalitarianism is always local. He rejoices in one point (p.72) that the "so-called inferior races" would be able to free themselves from imperialism in the absence of profit motive and the aggression of nation-states, but it's an open question whether he considers people of all ethnicities and creeds able to live together and share, or whether as Fukyama fears that even in the absence of profit motive and nation-states, we'd get fractious groupings based on prideful (thymotic) identifications. Does government currently serve as a needed check on millions of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield%E2%80%93McCoy_feud" target="_blank"&gt;Hatfield vs. McCoy &lt;/a &gt;type conflicts? Would anarchism foster world-cooperation or make dream even more distant?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/home/productlinks/customize?asin=0521459907 &amp;amp;request_source=quicklinks &amp;amp;subflow=sp_" target="_blank"&gt;the Cambridge Edition &lt;/a &gt;that we read. However, the English language edition is standard (approved by Kropotkin in 1908), so there's no loss except in the page numbering if you just &lt;a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread" target="_blank"&gt;read a public domain version online &lt;/a &gt;. You can also &lt;a href="https://librivox.org/conquest-bread-2-by-peter-kropotkin/" target="_blank"&gt;listen to the whole thing as an audiobook &lt;/a &gt;, which is a good way of getting through the tedious later chapters. We didn't really have a formal reading selection for this apart from "read ad much of it as possible, and skim over the boring actuarial details," but I think we all read through at least chapter 12 "Objections," and probably through 15 "The Division of Labor."

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded on Oct. 7 as we were prepping for Sun Tzu, we talk about guest dynamics: How did things work with Sandel? How much should we let the author-guest talk? Should we keep them on for part two, or would that be insulting to them if part two is paywalled? If we were to do an episode on trans issues, who should we get as a guest? Contrapoints won't answer our emails, sorry. Who should we get next as one of our rare philosophy-author guests?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-dark-side-of-meritocracy-review-of-the-tyranny-of-merit" target="_blank"&gt;Read Wes's review of Sandel's book &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://iai.tv/video/the-freedom-paradox?_auid=2020" target="_blank"&gt;Watch the discussion Mark moderated on free will with Dan Dennett et al &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

So why fight at all? The text assumes you have to for some reason.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Subsequent chapters present more strategy: how to play defense and offence. How to surprise attack vulnerable points to compensate for your lesser overall power. Can we apply Sunzi's advice to business?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lest we think Sunzi is all about minimizing risk and damage, he recommends throwing your troops into a desperate, no-escape situation, and then they'll fight like hell, whereas if you're still fairly close to home with clear escape routes, your people are going to quit at the first sign of danger. So there's that.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks for supporting PEL!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the Chinese military treatise attributed to Sunzi, literally "Master Sun," an honorific for a general named Sun Wu from the 5th or 6th century BCE. Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth are joined by ex-Marine Brian Wilson, host of &lt;a href="http://combatandclassics.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Combat &amp;amp; Classics &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does a philosopher wage war? The book provides advice both very practical (when setting fires, pay attention to the wind direction) and more abstract (be wise, reliable, humane, courageous and strict). We talk about what kind of philosophy this amounts to; secondary sources describe it as a Taoist text, but it's certainly a very active type of Taoism that would encourage one to seek a position of power and embrace conflict. However, Sunzi advises to only make a move when circumstances make victory likely; the default is to not make a move at all, and the best kind of war is one that can be won without any actual fighting. Moreover, the picture of virtue is very Taoist: Be calm in adversity, be objective in your evaluation of a situation and in your use of troops and other resources. Don't let your opponent goad you to attack, but do that instead to him.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We ponder the relationship between the general and the ruler: As general, you're in charge in the field even if this means ignoring the ruler's foolish orders to attack. You need to respond to the circumstances of the moment, and you need to discipline your troops to move as one. Most importantly, you need to &lt;em &gt;understand &lt;/em &gt;the circumstances, which means knowing your enemy, yourself, and the environment. You need to develop relationships with locals and deploy spies to gain some of this information. You need to use deception so that your opponent doesn't understand your situation and opportunities. It's not the full power of your forces that matters so much as what force is applied exactly how and when. You need to avoid protracted engagements that just tire everyone out. Just strike hard and fast when the time is right.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Clearly in outline this advice can be applied to many other adversarial arts beyond physical combat, from business to sports to politics, but there's perhaps in this text less that's directly applicable to any situation you'd have to deal with than you might think given the book's immense popularity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/31F76k4" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the 2020 Michael Nylan translation we read &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/132" target="_blank"&gt;get the free, older translation online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan and Seth continue the discussion on &lt;em &gt;The Tyranny of Merit &lt;/em &gt;to talk further about how social values can and do change, and whether these changes can be engineered in the way that Sandel seems to want.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are the only options letting the market determining values on the one hand and a centralized, command economy on the other? Is it inevitable that any attempt to improve our climate of ideas will be tyrannical, as conservatives accuse social justice warriors of advocating? Is Sandel asking that everyone become a philosopher, a requirement that will only reinforce the notion that those who disagree are ignorant and undeserving of respect?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;It may well be that Sandel's "broad equality of conditions" involves the kinds of measures advocated by Elizabeth Anderson (see our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/10/01/ep199-3-anderson/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 199 &lt;/a &gt;). Achieving this broad equality should go a good way in lessening the acuity of status differences. Status is determined over many contexts, for examples, within each activity or organization you're involved with. Can we de-emphasize the status associated with income and profession so as to disperse our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/02/11/ep209-1-fukuyama/" target="_blank"&gt;thymotic urges &lt;/a &gt;over these various contexts, resulting in a less class-oriented society?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Picture by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Tyranny of Merit: What's Become of the Common Good?&lt;/em &gt;(2020).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Previously, &lt;a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/sandel/home" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Sandel &lt;/a &gt;argued for the necessity for public policy to be driven by ethics (see our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/07/19/ep97-michael-sandel/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 97 &lt;/a &gt;) and then applied this to argue against a purely market-driven society (see our interview with him for &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/07/26/ep98-michael-sandel/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 98 &lt;/a &gt;). A society where everything is for sale seems obviously open to critique, but what about this idea that both of our political parties agree on: that society should be structured so that people rise in status based on their individual talents and effort, not on their class, ethnicity, or anything else superficial like that?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While Michael is happy to admit that meritocracy is better than a hereditary aristocracy, he doesn't think it's a sufficient basis for structuring a society. First, there's the liberal critique that the system doesn't actually work, that there's still bias, and much less mobility overall than Americans think. But much more fundamentally, even if we had a perfect meritocracy where talent and effort were always rewarded objectively, this would be dystopian. Why? Because it leaves the majority of society behind, labels them "losers," and in fact blames them for their failures. At least in a classed society, people are aware of the role of luck in giving them their station, but if your national ethic says that those making less money deserve less money, then you've got a lot of angry people ready to, for instance, vote for someone who makes them feel less humiliated.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This book is a diagnosis of our political ills: both parties believe in meritocracy, only Democrats think it still needs work to achieve, and Republicans think it's already functional. Neither of these positions properly values the common good. The pandemic has shown us that, for instance, "front-line workers" are undervalued by our market economy. Claiming that the vast inequalities of wealth and income are somehow justified by the fact that CEOs and hedge fund managers and the link work thousands of times harder than these workers is ridiculous. Offering an American Dream of possible escape from poverty by a select few while the rest are left behind is not enough. Emphasizing that "the more you learn the more you earn" promotes the prejudice of credentialing: that unless you have a college education, your contributions to society will not be valued. This is insupportable in a society where 2/3 of us don't have college educations. We all know people who despite being less educated, are more sensible, savvy, and/or wise than many college professors.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Besides which, hard work is never sufficient to rise: You have to have talent, which is not something that's under your control. You have to have a support system to buoy you. Even the energy to work hard is something that people naturally have different amounts of. Yet a meritocracy gives rise to arrogance in those that end up on top. They believe that they deserve their rewards, and this smugness makes them insensible of the needs of the rest of society, and makes the rest of society resent them further.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The emphasis on getting into the best schools, since that's what society deems as necessary for leadership, ruins the childhoods of the affluent and/or aspiring, leading to things like the college admissions scandal, helicopter parenting, and over-scheduled, over-worked teenagers who are trained into a hoop-jumping way of life that leaves them scarred and hyper-competitive when they finally enter adulthood.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So Michael has identified some things wrong with our national ethic. He thinks that we should place less emphasis on status and change the activities we revere so that these better reflect the moral value added to society rather than merely the financial value. Moreover, we need to think about justice not just as distributive--about who gets how much--but as contributive, since a fundamental part of our well-being is a feeling that we're contributing positively.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What can we actually do to bring about these changes? Michael has a list of legislative suggestions including changing college admissions practices, increased funding for trade schools, reducing the wealth gap through progressive taxation, and in general raising the common level of the least well off through both job creation and redistribution so that everyone can feel valued. Most importantly, though, changes in social ethics come through public discourse. Michael's book traces the rise of various rhetorical memes like "the more you learn, the more you earn" and "rise as far as your talents allow," and so this book is itself an attempt to discourage those ideas in favor of others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whatever the specific legislative solutions, we need to acknowledge the need for real dialogue about national values, and this can't be accomplished either by a social media environment where everyone is shouting past each other, nor a technocratic approach that pretends that the other side's disagreement is just a matter of their ignorance, and so the role of government should just be to give accurate information. As bad as misinformation is, correcting that will not be enough to achieve workable consensus. For instance, Michael points out that the most virulently anti-climate-science people are actually very well informed about the matter; it's not the case that as you learn more, you inevitably lean left, and in fact it's the least informed that don't have very strong opinions about the matter one way or the other.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth do a joint-interview/discussion for this first half, and we continue without Michael for the second half, trying to figure out how much social ethics concerning status actually can be changed and how to go about enacting change.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3lxix51" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded nearly a month ago before the world went that many more iterations of crazy, we talk about the decision to put part 2's behind the paywall and then read some listener feedback that kicks off a discussion of the relation of wokeness to the show.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark hypothesizes that something can be inadvertently racist if (and only if?) it's part of a "racist tradition." This idea was further explored with &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/partiallyexaminedlife/permalink/10158721600279660" target="_blank"&gt;our Facebook group &lt;/a &gt;. Wes doesn't like how nearly anything in history can be deemed "problematic"; he calls it a "chain of guilt by association" and claims that "all traditions are rooted in violence."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes confesses that he's anti-woke for most purposes, which is why he bugged out of episodes &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/10/21/ep228-social-construction-race-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;228 &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/07/20/ep248-racism-policing-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;248 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth has been getting his un-woke food for thought from &lt;a href="https://femsplainers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Femsplainers podcast &lt;/a &gt;. And yes, he's been checking out Jordan Peterson.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What do you all think of us using this forum to discuss politics (among other things), rather than the podcast itself?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on Gottfried Leibniz’s &lt;em &gt;Theodicy &lt;/em &gt;(1710).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get further into the weeds: What is the metaphysical necessity for evil? Leibniz says God doesn't actually cause evil; it's just that his optimal creation will necessarily have some evil in it. Just the fact that he's necessary and infinite, and his creation is contingent and finite means that creatures involve some lack, some privation, and evil is just such a privation. Just like we don't in physics think we need one explanation for light and another for dark (which is just the absence of light), so we should posit one explanation for good (instead of positing God and The Devil as equal and opposite forces, for instance). The essence of God is the explanation for good, but some created materials are more resistant to this good that comes from God than others. If the good doesn't get in them far enough to determine their actions, then there's evil. In human terms, we always seek the good, but since our judgment is imperfect (the light of truth doesn't always reach us), we can't always see what the good is, and so do unwise or downright malevolent things out of confusion. We're always the hero of our own story, acting on some reason, even if it's just outraged response to a perceived attack on our dignity, and we know how many terrible acts can be committed in such a reactionary way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also talk about the complexity of willing: Sure God wants us all to be happy. Leibniz calls this his "antecedent will," i.e. what he wills for each thing considered in isolation. But of course, in putting the whole universe together, there would be conflicts in trying to satisfy everyone, so his "consequent will" is the whole world as he actually wills it, which in particular cases may be very different than the good that he antecedently willed for us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also take on the "eternal verities," briefly look back to monads (see our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/07/31/episode-6-leibnizs-monadology-what-is-there/" target="_blank"&gt;episode six &lt;/a &gt;) and consider God as conserver of the world, i.e. the old metaphysical notion that God needs to be present at every point of causality in the universe in order for it to happen.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Gottfried Leibniz’s &lt;em &gt;Theodicy &lt;/em &gt;(1710), as considered by Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why does God allow so many bad things to happen, from diseases and other natural afflictions to violence insane and premeditated? This question is often used as a challenge to the existence of a good God as offered by traditional religion. If He's all-powerful and all-knowing, He could foresee any evil and prevent it from happening, yet He doesn't. If you were good and had such powers, wouldn't you step in? Presumably yes. So God must not be good in the way we think, or maybe there just isn't a God at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Leibniz thinks this is ass-backwards. First, he thinks it's obvious that there is a God, for all the traditional reasons (see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-43-arguments-15463020" target="_blank"&gt;our episode 43 &lt;/a &gt;). And once you accept that there is such a God, it follows from the definition of such a being that He'd create the best of all possible worlds. This way of putting it is novel, and introduces the way of thinking about counter-factual statements in terms of possible worlds (see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-240-david-on-35708747" target="_blank"&gt;our recent ep. 240 on David Lewis &lt;/a &gt;). God's omniscience means he not only can scan all actual states of affairs, but all possible arrangements of the world, and his goodness and omnipotence means he will choose the optimum one.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is an a priori argument, from the very definition of God (like his predecessor Descartes, Leibniz was a rationalist. So if you're ever looking at the world through your finite human eyes and see suffering and viciousness and plans going awry, just refer back to this reasoning. Now, famously, Voltaire's novel &lt;em &gt;Candide &lt;/em &gt;(see our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-62-voltaires-17045794"&gt;ep. 62 &lt;/a &gt;) satirized this attitude, where a Leibniz-like philosopher character named Pangloss travels with Candide looking on all sorts of horrible things and proclaiming that they're not actually horrible, because this is the best of all possible worlds! This picture misunderstands Leibniz, because Leibniz is not denying that the evil is in fact evil. He's just saying that it can't be the whole picture.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Leibniz gives many arguments and analogies for why God might have to permit some evil in the world in order to allow for greater overall good. Maybe people need the example of the wicked to motivate them to act contrarily, i.e. righteously. Chiefly, much of the evil in the world comes from people's poor choices, and though yes, God could have created people so that they never made poor choices, this wouldn't really be freedom, would it? Free will is a gift from God, a real boon when used well, and with that gift comes the risk that we'll use it poorly. Now granted, some people just have nicer dispositions, more wisdom, or more willpower and so are more easily able to make the right choices, and that seems unfair, since it's God that made us to have these qualities in the degree that we do (of course, we can work at improving ourselves, but even the disposition to do this seems inborn to some degree). In this sense, the problem of moral evil reduces to the problem of natural evil, which is evils like natural disasters that aren't the direct result of anyone's poor choice.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When we reflect on these natural evils, it's even harder to keep in mind the bigger picture. Leibniz ventures that our experience is limited. He actually posits that given how many stars are out there, there's no reason to think that there aren't alien worlds populated by rational beings. Maybe they're on the whole much happier than we are here, so that what we're seeing is the worst, but necessary part of this best possible universe ("world" in "possible world" meaning not just our planet but really the whole of creation). And why should we consider individual human happiness the thing that God has to maximize? There are plenty of other parts of creation, and maybe in optimizing its well-being, we get the short end of the stick. Leibniz even considers theological views whereby most people are damned and only a few are saved; even this sort of situation could be similarly rationalized.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, Leibniz is not actually a hard-ass in this way. He doesn't think that unbaptized babies or people in foreign lands who never heard the name of Jesus go to hell or any of that. He would deny the Buddhist doctrine that life is essentially suffering and instead observe that illness is actually the exception and health the rule. While our lives may not be drenched in pleasure, Leibniz can draw on the Stoics and Epicureans to say that we seldom receive more challenges than we can really take on, that we generate a lot of our own suffering through excessive striving, and can typically avoid terrible hardships and have resources to adapt to the ones that come our way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One complication that kept coming up for us in this discussion was the status of human free will, which Leibniz does not analyze directly in this text, other than to say that yes, we have it, even though God knows everything we're going to do before we do it, and that it's a good thing. Leibniz draws a parallel between God's "freedom" to choose only the best possible world and human freedom, which always likewise chooses the best insofar as we can figure out what that is (this is Plato's ethical doctrine). Leibniz disagrees with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/08/10/ep121-1-augustine/" target="_blank"&gt;Augustine &lt;/a &gt;that our freedom means we can deliberately choose the good. Leibniz is associated with the principle of sufficient reason, which is often taken as the claim that everything has a cause, which means that people's choices are part of the causal nexus and there's no real sense in which one could have chosen otherwise than one actually did (note that this is probably not what Leibniz meant by the principle of sufficient reason; this is discussed in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy if you're interested). On this interpretation, our choices aren't really free in the sense that they could have been otherwise, but they are nonetheless considered free if they involve rational deliberation between options: he's a compatibilist a la Kant and Dan Dennett. This is a complicated issue which our discussion does not solve; you might want to read about it in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The discussion continues in part two, where we get into the metaphysical status of evil (a privation), how God wills (antecedent vs. consequent will), and much more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2FVRfWX" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the public domain E.M.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;When we recorded this, we were still awaiting our Habermas recording; we discuss what secondary sources we use. How about you listeners?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Anarchism! Should we do an episode on it? We probably will, and probably before the end of 2020, but not immediately. Relatedly, should we have guests who are adherents of the philosophy we're discussing?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What was the episode we've recorded where the reading most pleasantly surprised each of us?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, you hear us discuss the possibility of front-loading our episodes. We're now trying to do this given that we've now pulled part two episodes behind the paywall, because we don't want all those cheapskates who only listen to part one two be totally frustrated. This will likely be a challenge, but luckily one you supporters don't much need to care about, except insofar as even you folks might like us to get more synoptic at the beginning anyway rather than just doing a close reading, starting minute one with page one and concluding in our last minute with whatever page we eventually get to. What do you all think about the way we structure things? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are making JUST THIS ONE Nightcap open to all listeners and not just supporters so folks can see what they're missing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing on Jürgen Habermas' “Actions, Speech Acts, Linguistically Mediated Interactions, and the Lifeworld" (1998), with guest &lt;a href="https://athousandtrivialities.com/" target="_blank"&gt;John Foster &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get into the details about the validity claims that are inherent in speech: When I make an assertion, I'm not just uttering a fact without context, but am (ordinarily, like not if I'm saying this in the context of playing a part in a play or lying to you) also claiming that you should believe what I'm saying: that it adequately describes the world, that I'm being sincere in saying it, and that it's appropriate for me to be saying this to you (e.g. this might be violated if I'm telling you something about your own mind that I couldn't possibly know but you most certainly do; it would be very unusual for it to be appropriate for me to tell you you are in pain, though perhaps if I'm acting as your therapist this would make sense).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So every utterance makes some validity claims, and that means that the hearer might say "no" to one or more of those claims. The telos within language toward social cohesion contains within it the risk of social rupture if the hearer refuses to take the suggestion to understand and agree with the statement. But that's what political life is like: Authentically political activity requires building consensus, unlike coercive social forms that for Habermas fundamentally violate this telos.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we get into Habermas's description of the life-world, that build-up of all the common understandings from past linguistic acts. The life-world forms the common understanding that establishes our various language games: what counts as worth saying, what counts as violating linguistic norms, etc. Some of this life-world knowledge is easily available to us when we reflect, and some of it is very deep-seated and would require real philosophical reflection to uncover. Some of it is dependent on the agreements within particular cultures, and some of it may just come from the fact that we're speaking persons at all. Habermas talks about the relation between these different parts of the life-world: for instance, how our confusing the various layers means that we consider some things to be unquestionable parts of nature rather than the socially contingent structures they actually are. But for a full exploration of his actual ethical/political program, we'd have to read something else. Should we?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Start with &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/09/13/ep-252-1-habermas-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part one &lt;/a &gt;, of course! Thanks for being a supporter. We're dividing the parts for you to really highlight that this is the supporter-exclusive half. With that in mind, we may well further change the way we divide activity between the parts, so that it's not just the first and second halves of the conversation, but the higher level overview in part one vs. the deep dive in part two. Maybe we'll even record these on different days sometimes. We'll see. If y'all strongly prefer the unbroken Citizen Edition, we can go back to posting it that way after a couple of episodes trying it this way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Jürgen Habermas' “Actions, Speech Acts, Linguistically Mediated Interactions, and the Lifeworld" (1998), with guest &lt;a href="https://athousandtrivialities.com/" target="_blank"&gt;John Foster &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the relation between individuals and society? Habermas says it's language. But don't picture this as fully formed but isolated animal individuals that then acquire language and thereby come together to form a society. Rather, what constitutes the human mind itself is largely sedimented language. We would not have self-consciousness in any robust sense without language. There would be biological organisms with qualia and some relations to each other, but the greater part of what we consider our mentality would be absent.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is to say that the human being is a social being, and the social framework that allows individuals to emerge is language. When we relate to one other, it can be in one of two ways: I can treat you like I treat a tool, ordering you around, manipulating you, just trying to get you to do what I want to fulfill some plan that I have. Or by contrast, I can try to get you to understand and agree with my plan so that it becomes our plan. In the course of this, I may in fact compromise my vision so that this cooperation is possible. Non-linguistic animals can deal with each other in the first way (which he calls "strategic action"), but according to Habermas, language is all about the second way ("communicative action"). Built into language itself is a telos (a purposive tendency) toward mutual understanding and cooperation. This is how Habermas gets "ought" from "is": Already in just speaking to each other, we're implicitly trying to be straight with each other, to see things in the same way and hence cooperate.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Of course, people do lie, do use language to manipulate each other, but this practice is parasitic on correct use of language. Habermas is taking this insight from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/10/19/ep10-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Kant &lt;/a &gt;: Lying as a concept wouldn't make sense if everyone lied all the time. In fact, we couldn't even understand each other. Lying has to be the exception rather than the rule, a derived (corrupted) practice rather than the norm. And because of this telos of ordinary language, we can see that lying and manipulation are wrong.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But apart from the ethical implication (which is important for Habermas, but not actually the goal of this essay), this means for Habermas that language is a binding force between us because it allows us to (in non-lying circumstances) access the motivations of other people. Habermas describes this as putting us in a "transmundane" position with regard to one another, almost like magic. If I just see you running on the street, I as an observer may or may not be able to figure out why you're doing that, but speaking is unlike running, because in speaking you (implicitly) announce your intentions, which in the case of an assertion is just for me as the person you're talking to understand and accept as valid whatever statement you just asserted. Or if you're commanding me, then you want me to accept that as a legitimate command and feel obliged to do the thing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here's where things get a little tricky, and you may want to refresh our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-186-j-l-on-17643711" target="_blank"&gt;episode 186 covering J.L. Austin on performatives &lt;/a &gt;. In that text, Austin describes certain sentences as accomplishing by their very utterance an action in the world, as when you say "I promise..." then you're not just describing yourself but creating an obligation for yourself. Austin implies at the end of the text that even assertions are in fact performative, that there's no strict distinction between performative and merely assertive utterances, but what he meant by this is not clear, and so we've been somewhat confused subsequently by, for instance, &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/02/04/ep235-butler-gender-trouble-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Judith Butler's claim that gender is performative &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Habermas fills in the gap here. Following Austin, Habermas claims that the basic thing we should be analyzing in the philosophy of language is not the sentence, but the utterance on a specific occasion, i.e. the sentence plus context. Austin divided the notion of linguistic meaning into the locutionary meaning, i.e. what the actual words mean in the dictionary, the illocutionary force, i.e. what the utterance performatively is supposed to accomplish (shared understanding in the case of an assertion, the feeling of obligation through a now-shared goal in the case of a command), and the perlocution, which includes the subsequent changes in the world brought about by the illocution (so maybe I now act based on believing your assertion or actually follow through and obey your command).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Habermas gives us the case of one person asking the other person to give a third person some money. The hearer understands (illocuationary success!) and accepts (another illocutionary success!) the request, and gives the money (the intended perlocutionary effect), which also happens to make that third person's wife very happy (another perlocutionary effect, but not the one actually intended).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Now, what if in this case I was giving you this command with the intention that the recipient of the money would then on my behalf commit a crime, like use the money to set up a robbery. The robbery would also be a perlocutionary effect, but different from the others mentioned above, because that intention of mine for the robbery to take place wasn't something I told you, and if I did, you likely wouldn't have given the robber that money. Habermas describes this action as "latently strategic" action. It seemed like I was engaging in an honest communicative action with you, but because I was hiding this intention, I was actually just using you. Sorry!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For something to be a truly communicative action, it has to pose a disputable claim to you, a question really: Will you accept what I'm saying as valid or not? If I make a request of you, you can clearly say no. If I'm your superior in the armed forces, which you've joined willingly and identified yourself as legitimately a soldier in this chain of command, even a command do you that you obey is something that you're participating in. If on the other hand I threaten you, then it's not really consent on your part: It's a strategic action for me, trying to get you to do what I want and not engaging in outreach to get your approval.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We wrap up part one here by being worried about whether this distinction is really as hard and fast as it looks. What about Stockholm Syndrome, when you joined an enterprise unwillingly but then are won over to it? What about if you join the military willingly but then your superior gets you to remember your place by threatening you? Aren't in real life there often sanctions looming over us to discourage us from disagreeing? How many of our choices or truly free?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In part two we get more into the idea of what the "validity claims" of a statement are and also into the "lifeworld," a term Habermas gets from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-31-husserls-11381067"&gt;Edmund Husserl &lt;/a &gt;about the shared web of belief that allows us to understand each other and is chock full of normative judgments about what's appropriate to do when.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This essay is chapter 4 in the collection &lt;em &gt;On the Pragmatics of Communication &lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3k8mnkb" target="_blank"&gt;Buy it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why is this not the "unbroken Citizen Edition" of old? Because Part Two is now exclusive to supporters, and we don't want the flood of new people who listened to part one publicly, realized they needed to sign up to hear part two, and jumped in here, to then have to jump to the middle of the Citizen Edition to figure out where part two starts. And we didn't want to waste your bandwidth by putting both the long Citizen Edition and the isolated part two in the citizen feed. So we're hoping that having two files instead of one doesn't irritate the existing supporters, but we may go back to one long file if enough people complain.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Theoretical Picture of a Free Society" (1934).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the ideal living situation for us all, given the peculiarities of human nature? Nine years before Weil laid out her list of human needs, as covered in our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/08/18/ep250-weil-needs-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;last episode &lt;/a &gt;, she wrote a work that she hoped to be her magnum opus, &lt;em &gt;Reflections Concerning the Causes of Liberty and Social Oppression &lt;/em &gt;. This included the "Analysis of Oppression" essay covered in our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/09/09/ep225-weil-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 225 &lt;/a &gt;, which described how very difficult it is for us to actually be free given how the world makes demands of us by making us work for food and shelter, and then these demands transmute themselves directly into our oppression by other people exert power over us and likewise force us to work and struggle. Immediately following that essay is this one, which purportedly gives us a picture of Weil's solution.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this essay, Weil sees society as a necessary evil, so the issue is not one of establishing a utopia, but of constructing a society that does as little damage as possible. Freedom, for Weil, is the ability to picture goals and concretely put them into practice. Freedom demands understanding: Understanding of these goals, understanding of the steps needed to achieve the goals, and understanding that what you're now doing at this moment constitutes one of those steps. This is very purposely designed on Descartes's rules for direction of the mind (our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/11/04/ep229-descartes-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 229 &lt;/a &gt;), where we only really understand something if we can see all the steps of the argument (like steps of a mathematical proof). The idea (common among philosophers from Aristotle to Kant to Dennett) is that yes, everything is determined in the great causal chain, but insofar as we act out of reason and not blind desire, we can call ourselves free. For Weil, reason here means conscious understanding, which allows us to identify the goals and actions as ours.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There's an interesting dynamic here, though. Routine work is dull; it's not intellectually stimulating in the way that Weil wants. But yet all work becomes routine, even very intellectual work that takes place at a high level of abstraction. Planning innovative ways of getting things done can itself become a dull routine. Since there's no way of avoiding this, Weil actually places a high value on raw, physical labor, which we should surrender to as the Stoic surrenders to the inevitability of death. She may be in the realm here of the attitude described in &lt;em &gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance &lt;/em &gt;(our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/02/03/ep50-pirsig-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 50 &lt;/a &gt;), where the key is not just attain to choose work that doesn't deaden you, but to adopt an attitude that enlivens you whatever the work is.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So again, the human task is to try to make peace with necessary evils and choose the least evil among them, to adopt a sort of active Stoic attitude that both adapts the environment to the organism and the organism to the environment. What best engages our faculties is to have social groups be small and working together, so that everyone can have an active role in decision-making and execution of plans. The typical society is on Weil's account horribly tyrannical over both mind and body, so there's still lots of room for revolutionary action to try to improve this before we reach the point of Stoic surrender.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gbg9gZ" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gbg9gZ" target="_blank"&gt;Oppression and Liberty &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gbg9gZ" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Libreville" by Bill Bruford's Earthworks.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "The Needs of the Soul" from The Need for Roots (1943) and "Meditation on Obedience and Liberty" (1937).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What are human needs that should drive what kind of society would be best for us? Weil says we need liberty yet obedience, equality yet hierarchy, security yet risk... and none of these words mean quite what you'd think.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For one, we need "order," and by this she doesn't mean a government exerting an iron fist, but a clear ordering of our obligations with a minimum of conflict between them.  It's not a matter of social convention but of something "eternal" (think Kant's categorical imperative, but she has a largely unstated religious basis for this insistence) that we owe each other consideration. If someone is in trouble to my right and to my left, and I can only help one of them, that doesn't remove my obligation to the one I wasn't able to help. A society can help here by clarifying my duties so that I know which to help, and can also work to make it rare that I'd be faced with such a dilemma. If a society declares, however, that one of the lives is not grieveable (to use Butler's term), like I'm only obligated to help my fellow countrymen, then it's doing damage.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A lot of the elaboration of these needs likewise turns into some specifications of optimal political circumstances, or more often present puzzles as to what society could possibly serve these extensive and complicated needs. We have a need for private property, but also communal property, so what sorts of social situations would optimize our opportunities for both kinds of experiences? We have a need to be obedient, but only to obey with consent: A dictator robs ironically robs us of the ability to obey in this way. We also have the need for leadership, at least some of the time. So what social configurations would optimally allow for these contrasting experiences? She denies Aristotle's "golden mean" as not actually fulfilling either need. What we instead require is to have each need fulfilled completely, but in alternation, so maybe we lead in one role that we play, but obey in another.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Her conception of societies, or really groups at any size and level of complexity, is that they should serve individual human needs. They are only valuable insofar as they are food for individuals. Creating a group, with its infrastructure and customs and functions, is a real achievement, and most groups do their members some good, so we should usually try to reform rather than destroy them, but they also exhibit pernicious tendencies like making their members conform in their opinions. Weil thinks that groups should never be allowed to excommunicate members based on what they believe. If a group is oppressive, it's not serving its function. In short, a group is our food.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Conversely, what is our responsibility toward a group? Just the same responsibility that we have toward food. If the food is in danger, and I must fight for the death for it lest everyone starve, then I should do that. But the group itself has no interests, no needs, no mind, no obligations, and while we should respect it for its function as food, there's no place for worship of the group or its representatives. We're all just human, and deserve the same amount of respect as human beings. We all exert that eternal obligation on each other, and groups should function in service of that, not to create hierarchies without function or oppress minorities or the like.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One of our needs is for truth, and because of that, she thinks that we have no right to lie to each other, and so while government should give us absolute freedom of thought and speculation, insofar as we're speaking to convince others, to effect political change, we can legitimately be prevented from hurting each other with words, which includes lying, irresponsible gossip, praising morally pernicious behavior. She really ends with a pretty restricted view of free speech despite her demand that free thought is absolutely necessary for us to to use our minds properly, and that being able to articulate ourselves is a necessary part of thought.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I've been describing "The Needs of the Soul" so far, which we go through at length (the public release for this episode will run over three weeks instead of the usual two; we recorded the last third of this discussion on a different day). Before getting to this, we considered the short fragment (about 6 pages) "Meditation on Obedience and Liberty," where Weil asks "why do the many obey the few?" Her answer: Because the many aren't organized and, because there are so many of them, they can't be, whereas the few that oppress them do organize themselves. But it's odd, isn't it, that if by practical necessity someone lords over us, because that person understands and controls the means of production or whatever the ruling apparatus is, that we naturally feel inferior as a result of this situation. This natural, detrimental hierarchy is what she wants to head off, even as she recognizes other kinds of hierarchies as actually fulfilling human needs for recognition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3h7jzTv" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3h7jzTv" target="_blank"&gt;The Need for Roots &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which contains "The Needs of the Soul," or &lt;a href="https://www.docdroid.net/rKuInyQ/simone-weil-the-need-for-roots-prelude-to-a-declaration-of-duties-towards-mankind-pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gbg9gZ" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gbg9gZ" target="_blank"&gt;Oppression and Liberty &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which contains "Meditation on Obedience and Liberty," or &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gbg9gZ" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This episode was commissioned by Charles, who wants to dedicate it to Temple Grandin, whose work he describes as similar to Weil's. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Even Though the Darkest Clouds" by liar, flower.

This time we talk about whether we should do more non-Western philosophy, and if not, does that make us racist? Also, maybe more episodes on communications and rhetoric? Or finally personal identity? It's looking very likely that John Locke will be coming in just a few episodes, but maybe let's not hold our breaths about it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're still figuring out how to best survey y'all on an ongoing basis re. topics you'd like us to cover. Feel free to message us if you have additional thoughts about this, even if it's just to remind you of something you already asked us about years ago. Also, we talk about PEL Live Remove 2020.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On John Dewey's &lt;em &gt;How We Think &lt;/em &gt;(1910) ch. 1 and &lt;em &gt;Democracy and Education &lt;/em &gt;(1916) ch. 1, 2, 4, and 24.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What model of human nature should serve as the basis for education policy? Dewey sees the scientific method as a refinement of ordinary thinking: We wonder about something, and experiencing that uncomfortable uncertainty, we jump for an explanation. Education should train us to be comfortable entertaining that uncertainty for a longer period, holding out for a better explanation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;em &gt;Democracy and Education &lt;/em &gt;, Dewey sketches out the function of education: To enable transmission of culture. Most of this is done informally, by doing activities together. But with more complex culture to pass down, formal schooling on symbolic matters (i.e. books) is also needed. We need to be sure that this still stays rooted in practical concerns, though; school shouldn't be merely theoretical, though. We need to avoid a split between what we've learned consciously in school and what we've learned unconsciously through daily activity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Education is a form of human growth, and school and society are both educational environments: we shape the environment to call out the responses that seem to maximize growth. These are going to be somewhat different for every person. We want to harness that person's interests and energy in their own learning, not teach through command or merely stimulus and response. And again, we're not just accumulating knowledge here, but acquiring habits that constitute social life. The primary task of school is to train us to be better learners, and so able to continue to grow. Dewey thinks we should try to eliminate the bad habits of perception and judgment that constitute poor taste and degenerate living. We want school to both show us different ways of life but also perform a unifying, assimilative function to enable us all to live together as one democratic society.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth (who had to jump off to tend to his child before we finished) are joined by educational theorist &lt;a href="http://degreeoffreedom.org/welcome-partially-examined-life-listeners/" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Haber &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3fsCB4W" target="_blank"&gt;Purchase &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3fsCB4W" target="_blank"&gt;Democracy and Education &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/852/852-h/852-h.htm" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://librivox.org/democracy-and-education-by-john-dewey/" target="_blank"&gt;listen to it &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/31dmq6H" target="_blank"&gt;Purchase &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/31dmq6H" target="_blank"&gt;How We Think &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37423/37423-h/37423-h.htm" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;. or you can hear (all of?) the chapter we read as part of the &lt;a href="https://boringbooksforbedtime.libsyn.com/how-we-think-by-john-dewey-reading-1" target="_blank"&gt;Boring Books for Bedtime podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Too Far to Turn Around" by The Ides of March, whose leader Jim Peterik appears on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem126-jim-peterik/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #126 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Do you remember our early episodes, when before getting down to the topic, we'd catch up a bit, maybe bring up something in the news or the world of philosophy, or read a listener email? That was fun, right? But then impatient people complained, and we got more serious about covering our readings well, so we mostly stopped doing that. When we have a guest, maybe we rap about their background, but otherwise, it's straight to business.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan are committing ourselves to recording a special, short chat every couple of weeks (usually on the off week between episode releases) just for you supporters, where we can blow off some steam, talk about what topics we might want to cover on the show, respond to listener feedback and what's going on in the world, or just bring up an interesting topic that we're not (right then) doing an episode about.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So here's our first attempt, recorded immediately before episode 249 without the guest. How are you all handling the pandemic? We're starting to get ready for a Simone Weil episode, which someone's actually paid me to do (spoiler: it ended up being a three-parter, super fun). Get a behind-the-scenes look at how we pick and refine our exact reading assignment in two weeks running up to an episode. Also, anticipating Wes's new subText (which he's recorded like a dozen episodes for now that will be coming out starting in August). If one of us misses an episode, does that person actually listen to it afterwards? Do you listen to PEL episodes more than once? Tell us your listening habits!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you want to know exactly what we're reading for these Dewey and Weil episodes, and everything going forward, please check &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PartiallyExLife" target="_blank"&gt;our Twitter feed &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The suggestion from our listener email was &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2CUHeHV" target="_blank"&gt;Morality by Degrees: Reasons Without Demands &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;by Alastair Norcross.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Alia Al-Saji’s “A Phenomenology of Hesitation: Interrupting Racializing Habits of Seeing” (2014), Maurice Merleau-Ponty's “The Spatiality of One’s Own Body and Motility" from &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Perception &lt;/em &gt;(1945), Linda Martín Alcoff’s “Identity as Visible and Embodied” and “Perception" sections from &lt;em &gt;Visible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self &lt;/em &gt;(2006), and ch. 1 of Alex Vitale's &lt;em &gt;The End of Policing &lt;/em &gt;(2017).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is there such a thing as subconscious racism, and if so, how could we possibly root it out and fix our policing problems? Mark, Seth, and Dylan are joined by ex-cop &lt;a href="https://www.southwestern.edu/live/profiles/25831-phil-hopkins" target="_blank"&gt;Phil Hopkins &lt;/a &gt;to look at what phenomenology might contribute to these issues. Merleau-Ponty claimed that "knowing how" is prior to "knowing that," that bodily comportment is our primary way of being oriented in the world. We're not disembodied minds that just have beliefs about the world, so changing behavior can't just be about changing beliefs.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Alcoff applied M-P's thought to talk about identity, race, and gender: We see according to schemes and categories that are shaped by our experience as bodies. Per DuBois and Fanon, being black in a racist society means seeing yourself as objectified.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Privilege, by contrast, is an "ontologically expansive" way of comportment: You see your own judgments about things as objective, and narcissistically project yourself into the world. This on the one hand can result in treating others as objects or as pre-categorized. A police officer with a military mindset perceives everyone as potential criminals and may prejudge classes of people as essentially criminal. He sees his job as having to control the situation, so even momentary defiance becomes a threat to that control.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The other way this privilege manifests, ironically, is through humanism. The idea that color is only skin-deep, and we're all the same sounds great, of course, and is in very important and obvious ways true. But that can mean that we fail to see genuine otherness, in particular the fact that people of color have this historically grounded experience of objectification. The attempt to "see eye to eye" with someone may mean that you're actually imputing your own viewpoint to them and so judging them as you'd judge yourself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Al-Saji uses Alcoff and M-P to outline a productive approach, and she articulates it in two ways. She sometimes describes her program as critical-ethical vision. The "critical" part is about uncovering the social bases for our habits of seeing. If white supremacy is baked deep into our culture, then it might require more than saying "Racists were wrong! Everyone's equal!" to stop seeing according to racialized patterns. The "ethical" part is about retaining the good part of humanism: We don't want to see people as merely victims of their social circumstance, because we all act in our own way in response to these circumstances; we're all moral agents.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One illustration Al-Saji gives for this is the outrage that Westerners often feel at seeing someone wearing a veil. We see this as a symbol of injustice, of a woman being caged by an oppressive culture, and we feel righteous indignation. It would be surprising to most of us to be called "racist" on the basis of this reaction, but this is exactly the challenge that Al-Saji is giving us. After all, the people we'd consider overt racists experience their racism as moral outrage too. She describes her European husband as having this very reaction, but this lessened as he lived around her family, some of whom wear veils, and understood them as individuals with complex, idiosyncratic relationships to the practice. He could eventually understand them as wearing veils with their moral agency intact, not merely as members of a victim class, but this was not a matter of merely "changing beliefs" about the situation. Al-Saji wants us to "see with" others, to expand our communities of seeing so that we're not stuck in our preconceptions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The second way she puts this is in terms of hesitation, which means literally stopping to interrogate your own habits of seeing, and so loosening those habits. It's like mindfulness, but not if that means stopping and applying some doctrine (compassion or Stoicism or remembering the no-self or anything like that), but being open to real Otherness, to the unexpected, to what people actually have to say for themselves. Al-Saji thinks this can be done without becoming more tentative, more timid (i.e., the way that women are already taught to hesitate and yield as they move around in the world). Instead of walking around in a fixed role (e.g., a cop looking for criminals), we open ourselves up to think and act differently.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These were the readings that Phil brought in for us. He uses them to teach an Embodied Self class to undergraduates, and has also run anti-racism seminars and has done some advising of law enforcement. But as he readily admits, there's a great deal of distance between these philosophical insights and actual police reform. The Vitale book (which we didn't address in much detail at all) describes past efforts to train police to be less racist or violent as largely failures, so adding Al-Saji's formulas to a new round of training is not likely to be all that effective either. As Phil emphasizes based on his experiences as part of law-enforcement culture, it's the culture itself that needs to change, which is of course very difficult. The hope is that a better understanding of how beliefs and behavior interact will help here.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Al-Saji article is a chapter in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3jp8kao" target="_blank"&gt;Living Alterities: Phenomenology, Embodiment, and Race &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, Emily Lee, ed.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the &lt;em &gt;Rhetoric &lt;/em &gt;(ca. 335 BCE) book 1, ch. 1-6 and book 2, ch. 1-5, 18-24.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What role does persuasion play in philosophy? In Plato's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-69-plato-on-17046616" target="_blank"&gt;Gorgias &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, Socrates condemns the sophists who taught rhetoric for merely endowing their students with social power over others, power that would make them neither happy nor virtuous. Philosophy should be about getting at the truth. Aristotle acknowledges this, but still thinks that rhetoric is useful, like, say, when you have the truth about whether you've corrupted the youth of Athens and need to convince a jury of that truth so that they don't condemn you to death. That ability might come in handy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though the &lt;em &gt;Rhetoric &lt;/em &gt;as a whole does talk about things you might expect from a public speaking guide (vocal tone, poise, etc.), the parts we read focused on the uses of rhetoric, the structure of its arguments, and the emotions of the audience whom the speaker needs to be cognizant of in tailoring a speech. Rhetoric as Aristotle teaches it can be used in courts of law (where it argues about whether or not specific things happened, which is different than philosophy which explores more general truths), in the legislature (we should pursue some specific course of action), and in speeches praising or blaming someone (like at a funeral, festival, or when engaging in political activity not related to some specific piece of legislation you're trying to push). In all of these cases, Aristotle thinks that people are likely to believe the truth if it's spelled out for them in ways they can understand. It's in the speaker's power to manipulate them and argue for debased things, but Aristotle of course doesn't want rhetoric used that way, and it's actually going to be harder to do so than to clearly present a valid argument.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle is well known for his works of logic (we'll get to them someday!), and this text gives us a taste of that: The main unit of Aristotelian logic is the &lt;a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/#H9" target="_blank"&gt;syllogism &lt;/a &gt;, which if fully spelled out has three parts: two premises leading to a conclusion. But of course, when you're actually talking to someone, you don't diagram arguments, and in fact you leave lots of your premises as unstated, shared assumptions. In the &lt;em &gt;Rhetoric &lt;/em &gt;, Aristotle calls this kind of incompletely-presented syllogism an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthymeme" target="_blank"&gt;enthymeme &lt;/a &gt;. You want to understand the assumptions of your audience so that you don't waste time arguing for claims that they'll already agree with, and if possible, you should even use maxims, which are cliches that resonate with the audience: claims that in that situation will require no proof even though a philosopher would likely dispute them (is it really the case that you can never "teach an old dog new tricks"?).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Syllogisms provide the forms for deductive arguments (where the proof of the premises would guarantee the truth of the conclusion); Aristotle also in this texts introduces inductive arguments, but they're not inductive in the Humean sense where we see lots of examples of something like white swans and conclude that probably all swans are white. For Aristotle, induction in rhetoric means you present one example of something (like a political leader who became corrupt after being given absolute power) and use that to argue a general point (we shouldn't give leaders absolute power). There's still an element of probability in it (would every leader be corrupted in that situation?), but the idea is that the example is exposing you to the essence of the thing (the nature of corrupting power), so you can draw the general conclusion or apply it to a new case (we shouldn't give our current president absolute power).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The beginning of book two deals with emotions, and our conversation focuses pretty much only on anger, following up on &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/08/01/ep144-1-nussbaum/" target="_blank"&gt;our conversation with Martha Nussabaum &lt;/a &gt;about this. The Aristotelian theory of emotions runs counter to our picture of emotions as the irrational counter to reason. No, emotions involve beliefs, and anger specifically involves a belief that someone has done you wrong, has insulted you, and a desire for revenge for that affront. Similarly, fear involves a belief that something is dangerous, and the emotion of friendship involves a belief that someone likes you and shares your interests, likes, and dislikes. Hatred is unlike anger in that it's a desire for the person not to exist; it can't be expiated by the person showing contrition or getting the revenge that anger demands. Aristotle performs this analysis of various emotions because it's useful information for a speaker; you have to understand how to navigate around an audience's anger, how to present yourself as someone who shares their concerns, how to calm them or incite them. Despite his earlier warnings about only using rhetoric to argue for the truth, his presentation here is pretty empowering, potentially even amoral.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can &lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.html" target="_blank"&gt;read the book online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://librivox.org/rhetoric-by-aristotle/" target="_blank"&gt;listen to it &lt;/a &gt;, but you'd be much better off getting a good translation with commentary. We preferred &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3dZ6OI5" target="_blank"&gt;the Joe Sachs &lt;/a &gt;(which packages the text with Plato's &lt;em &gt;Gorgias &lt;/em &gt;), though the preferred scholarly version seems to be &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/31VxCH7" target="_blank"&gt;the George Kennedy translation &lt;/a &gt;, which definitely had a helpful introduction.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Reason with the Beast" by Shriekback, whose leader Barry Andrews was interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem107-barry-andrews/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #107 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Picture by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;On Sontag's essays “Against Interpretation” (1964), “On Style” (1965), and "The Death of Tragedy” (1963).&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is it to understand a work of art? Sontag objects to critics' need to decode or translate literature into it's "meaning" or "content," divorcing it in the process from how this content is embodied. She argues that this content vs. form distinction isn't tenable; that the style of a work is an essential part of experiencing it. Like Nietzsche, Sontag thinks we're too analytical, too divorced from our instincts, and a direct encounter with art is essential to enliven us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"Against Interpretation" is the direct statement of this view. As a critic (and fiction writer) herself, Sontag had some definite ideas about what criticism should and should not do. It should help orient us to better understand a work. It should not seek to replace the work, to restate "what the work is trying to say" in simpler terms, to distill out the philosophical points, and definitely not to translate it according to some set of interpretative principles, which is what she accuses Freudian and Marxist interpreters of doing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what's the alternative? What is it to engage with a work instead of standing at a distance and analyzing it? Well, it's not what the average person does either, which, according to &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/5/53/Ortega_y_Gasset_Jose_1925_1972_The_Dehumanization_of_Art.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;José Ortega y Gasset's "The Dehumanization of Art"&lt;/a &gt;(which this essay is in large part an elaboration of and reaction to), is to identify with the characters and get sucked into the drama of the story. This too would be a matter of ignoring the work as art and zeroing in on its content, taken in this case as human drama and not as its "message." Sontag agrees with Ortega y Gasset and Kant that appreciating art means appreciating its form. However, she's with Nietzsche and Schopenhauer in insisting that this is an ecstatic, disturbing experience, that we're not just beholding the form that an artist's will has taken, but participating in it, because that's how wills work with each other: The spectator essentially vibrates at the unique frequency of the work of art. This is philosophically important because art "educates the will to be in the world."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"On Style," an essay that we introduced in our Shahidha Bari interview, gives us a complimentary way of making the same point. If the "message," the translated core, is the content of a work, then the style would be its form. As modern intellectuals, we're trained to see style as just the surface, as literally shallow, to be pierced through to get to what's deep and important. But the style is the rhythm of the work, it is what I just metaphorically called its frequency, and so is actually an inseparable part of the work's depth (its soul, if you will). Yes, some writers are more "stylized" than others, in that they are more playful or ornate with language, but we can't pretend that there's "style-less" writing. The simple sentences of Ernest Hemingway (or Camus's style in &lt;em &gt;The Stranger &lt;/em &gt;, which is an expression of the blankness of the protagonist) still count as a distinct style.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One significant complication: Sontag praises in section 9 of "Against Interpretation" the idea of "transparence.. the highest, most liberating value in art--and in criticism--today. Transparence means experiencing the luminousness of the thing itself, of things being what they are." So the critical work should ideally present "a really accurate, sharp, loving description of a work of art." But clearly Sontag herself, as a critic (like &lt;a href="http://prettymuchpop.com/2020/03/25/pmp36-critic-noah-berlatsky/" target="_blank"&gt;Noah Berlatsky &lt;/a &gt;), is writing these essays not to just transparently expose us to good works of art, but to use works as a springboard to make some independent philosophical points. That seems to be exactly what Lacan is doing in his psychoanalytic analyses: explicating a work, yes, but not trying to replace it, but to give us more. Sontag is against this: She thinks we in the modern age are so overwhelmed by works that we shouldn't be seeking to multiply them, but to experience move vividly, with more transparence. People who praise Hemingway and complain about the style of a work being too showy do, according to this transparence ethic, have a legitimate point: An artist can clearly get in his or her own way (some day I'll feel comfortable using "their" in this context in a blog post, but not quite yet; hey, this parenthetical digression is illustrating my point by disrupting the flow of my sentence!), and a masterful stylist will create a "frequency" that is unified, that is most amenable to vibrating along with it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we brought in a third essay, "The Death of Tragedy," to more directly connect Sontag's views to our recent episodes on tragedy. We wondered in that discussion that if tragedy as a literary form gets so clearly at a core element of our psychology, why don't we see more tragedies in modern entertainment? Sontag in this essay is reacting to Lionel Abel's writings on metatheatre. Abel said that right, the age of tragedy has passed, and Sontag agrees, but there's some argument as to what it is about modern sensibilities that make us resonate less with classical tragedy. According to Abel, it's our added reflectiveness, our skepticism. This is what makes the modern era the age of metatheatre, that self-questioning, self-reflective form that often shows plays within plays, claims that "all the world's a stage," "life is but a dream," etc. (PEL discussed this in episode 217 on Calderon.) According to Sontag, these self-referential elements were already present in ancient theater as elements of comedy. What we've lost is the vision of the world as irredeemably bleak, which is really the lesson of ancient tragedy: Bad things just happen to good people. (She refers to Simone Weil's take on the Iliad as an example of this: War is hell!) What's Sontag's alternative? "The modern dream—which the modern metaplays project—is a nightmare, a nightmare of repetition, stalled action, exhausted feeling." This explains why modern tragedy looks more like &lt;em &gt;The Plague &lt;/em &gt;than &lt;em &gt;Antigone &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can find all three of these essays, as well as hilarious essays targeting Sartre and Camus, in her collection, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3erhEHX" target="_blank"&gt;Against Interpretation and Other Essays &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Mela" by Julie Slick, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem115-julie-slick/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #115 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Picture by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Jacques Derrida's "The Animal That Therefore I Am" (1999) p. 1–16, Michel Foucault's "The Ethics of the Concern of the Self As A Practice of Freedom" (1984), Susan Sontag's "On Style" (1965), and our guest &lt;a href="https://www.shahidhabari.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Shahidha's &lt;/a &gt;book &lt;em &gt;Dressed: A Philosophy of Clothes &lt;/em &gt;(2020) p. 1–22, 205–217.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Much historical philosophy takes appearance to be the mere covering to be ignored in favor of the soul, essence, or content beneath. Even though our dominant metaphysics has changed, this prejudice continues. How we dress is part of how we act, and it's the sum of those actions that makes our character. The "face we put forward" doesn't just express or reflect some idea of ourselves but contributes to making those "selves" a reality. To wear clothes (says Shahidha) is to be linked to a society, in the ways Adam Smith described (how many hands went into providing their components, design, manufacture, and distribution?) and to be part of cultural tropes and traditions (in some ways a language), to participate in a social order that places limits on what may be worn, when and where, and by whom, and to have a certain relation to nature (especially interesting if you're wearing animal skin or fur).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We previously read Simone De Beauvoir in the "Social Life" chapter of &lt;em &gt;The Second Sex &lt;/em &gt;talk about how clothing is used to control women, but the concern of our selection from Shahidha's book and of these other readings she selected for us (which are all footnotes in &lt;em &gt;Dressed &lt;/em &gt;) is largely clothing's liberatory aspect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Derrida reflects on the experience of being naked and seeing how his cat is looking at him. In an obvious sense, the cat is also naked, but really, nakedness requires a contrast with being clothed. It requires a notion of shame and an identification of oneself as distinct from some animal that runs around without clothes or shame. But in that moment of being naked before the naked animal, free from social expectations, Derrida thinks one's philosophy should be radically re-oriented, that we should recognize deep down that despite our pretensions, we're animals, not souls set into bodies. (What he actually does with this insight, we're not sure, as we didn't read the rest of this typically difficult essay.) Shahidha's book reflects on this alienation from ourselves that Derrida has pointed out here. In wearing another animal's skin as gloves, for instance, we should feel pretty profoundly weird, but instead we forget or take for granted our animal nature and pretend to be thoroughly civilized. As Kristeva pointed out, there's a certain horror in being reminded of our biological origins, and we're all to happy to turn our attention away from it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Foucault in this interview we read, documented in the last year of his life, expresses an interest in subjectivity not emphasized in his earlier work (which is largely about systems, like the prison system and our concepts of sickness and health). He describes a common misconception that with liberation from social constraints, we become free. No, says Foucault, liberation is necessary but not sufficient to provide freedom, because we're not some fully formed, autonomous self that is being held back from its full potential, but our selves need to be built, cultivated, and cared for. Relatedly, though Foucault sees power relations everywhere, the goal is not to be free of all such relations. Every relationship involves power relations; to be free of them would be free of other people, which are necessary ingredients for building oneself. We just want to make sure that we're not in highly unequal, systematically frozen power relationships. Power relationships need to be controlled by practices of freedom, and a chief goal of philosophy is to address what Foucault calls "the ethical problem of the practice of freedom." He points to ancient Greek philosophy, which was not directly about acting toward others, but about cultivating virtue in yourself, with the idea that if you do that effectively, this will as a consequence involve proper comportment toward other people. This self-care can and should include care for one's appearance, which (for Shahidha Bari) includes thinking about clothing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Sontag's "On Style" is, like Foucault's account, not directly about clothing. She's talking about literature, and the misleading style vs. content distinction that she sees rampant in the way critics and the reading public analyze writing. It's not the case, Sontag says, that we can get rid of style and see right to content. The style is in fact part of the content, and is, on Sontag's account, a mnemonic device for getting us to internalize the work, e.g., it makes you groove along with the song, remember the rhyme, connect with the colors, or whatever. She's concerned with us having vital immediate relations with artworks, not trying to strip off their style through analysis, effectively translating them into messages or other content. You should be able to see the parallels.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Shahidha encourages us to use these considerations to deeply reflect on our embodiment. While Merleau-Ponty led us through phenomenological reflection on having a body, Shahidha extends this kind of analysis to clothing, and her book is groundbreaking in arguing for this as a legitimate philosophical concern.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/377DLAv" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/377DLAv" target="_blank"&gt;Dressed: A Philosophy of Clothes &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Albert Camus' novel &lt;em &gt;The Plague &lt;/em &gt;(1947), which has been selling out lately like N95 COVID-19 face masks. How shall we face adversity? Camus gives us colorful characters that embody various approaches. Should we put faith in God (Paneloux), or refuse to believe that a God would allow such suffering (Rieux)? Should you dwell on the one you love that the plague is keeping you from (Rambert)? Or should you aspire to sainthood (Tarrou), or throw yourself into your art (Grand), or profit from chaos (Cottard)? &lt;a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/plague/characters/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a quick cheat sheet &lt;/a &gt;describing these characters if you get lost.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth are all here to talk about this modern, &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/06/22/episode-4-camus-and-the-absurd/" target="_blank"&gt;existential &lt;/a &gt;tragedy. Yes, the plague is an extreme situation, but we're all dying all the time anyway even though we ignore that fact and go about our business, with our shallow passions and our belief that nothing truly terrible could happen. Is the book an allegory for the creep of fascism, or for the French experience of World War II, or perhaps it's not an allegory at all, but a very thoroughly researched, gripping piece of very realistic fiction, with essentially two narrators, one (Rieux) a medical professional and the other (Tarrou, whose journal Rieux paraphrases frequently and at length) an alienated but insightful philosophical observer not unlike Sartre in &lt;em &gt;Nausea &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2zjAamx" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/plague02camu/plague02camu_djvu.txt" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;, or &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XKnCnY5wbxU" target="_blank"&gt;listen to it on YouTube &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "You Will Kill the One You Love" by Jack Hues, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem122-jack-hues/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #122 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Recorded 1/26/14 by Mark Linsenmayer with Stanley Martin, Sean Webb, and Yannick Kilberger as a follow-up to &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/01/19/ep87-sartre/" target="_blank"&gt;PEL ep. 87 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The novel &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811220303/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0811220303 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20" target="_blank"&gt;Nausea &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;gives perhaps a more vivid picture than his straight-up philosophy writings of what existentialism &lt;em &gt;feels &lt;/em &gt;like. The narrator feels the raw existence of his surroundings: “existence which unceasingly renewed itself and which was never born” (p. 132). What seems to happen is that while ordinarily we see objects as meaningful, e.g. as tools, as decoration, as things with history and often purpose, we can set that aside and see things instead as brute and meaningless. We can’t handle that, aren’t meant to handle that, and so instead of this being a machine-like, unemotional way of experiencing things, it is intolerably icky.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So before he figures this out (and spells it out for us), we get 80+ pages of him just walking around the French city of Bouville having variations on this experience of slipping: of his own perceptions slipping away from the usual, engaged type that doesn't look too hard. We get a few hints in his observations of others of "bad faith," but no real diagnosis of the protagonist himself. Is he sick? In bad faith? Is he doing phenomenology for us, showing us what all of us can see if we adopt this viewpoint which is somehow primal or important? He eventually has a couple of conversations so we can compare and contrast his view with others: a self-proclaimed humanist, and then his ex-girlfriend who's had similar experiences, also feeling that she's "outlived herself" and can no longer find life dramatic and engaging. Roquentin is not able to personally connect with either of these people, but we get some hope at the end that we may be able to sort of connect with others sympathetically through art.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite its gorgeous language, vivid imagery, and some philosophical interest, it's still a hard slog, and we all felt pretty proud of ourselves for getting through it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/pel-not-school-introduction/" target="_blank"&gt;Not School &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;is a feature of &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/10/06/introducing-the-pel-citizen-commons-and-not-school-study-groups/" target="_blank"&gt;PEL Citizenship &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;that we're not able for technological reasons to make automatically available to you, our Patreon friends.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;These probably-lecture-notes from around 335 BCE are still used in screenwriting classes today: Aristotle serves up a formula for what will most move us, derived from Sophocles's tragedies like &lt;em &gt;Oedipus Rex &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is art? Aristotle says it's mimesis (imitation), and fiction (poetry) is imitation of human action in particular, in a manner that shows us what human nature is all about. Unlike history, which tells about a specific thing that happened, fiction uses a specific situation to present something universal, the kind of thing likely to happen given human nature. By seeing a great (but flawed) hero brought low, we experience a mix of pity and fear that gets these bad feelings out of our system; this text is where the term "catharsis" comes from.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A few pieces of advice Aristotle gives about putting together a story: Plot (mythos) is more important than character development. The plot structure is much more important than the spectacle of actually performing the thing: the actors, the music, etc. So what makes a good plot? Well, it should have a big reveal and a sudden reversal of the hero's fortunes, preferably at one and the same point. Also, it should be short enough that you can take in the beauty of the work in more or less one glance, and every element included should be an essential part of an organic whole. And in tragedy, the characters should be better than we audience members, or else we won't identify with and pity them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you recall &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/06/09/ep77-santayana-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our Santayana episode on art appreciation &lt;/a &gt;, you'll be on the watch for theories like this that are clearly post hoc descriptions of something that the author particularly appreciates. Though the lauded tragic plays of his time are what he most clearly has in mind, he also discusses Homer and argues that, for instance, the action of the &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/03/04/ep185-homer-odyssey-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Odyssey &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, though clearly too long to encompass in once glance, can be distilled down to a single plot description (a guy floats around for a while before he's able to get home and put his house in order). Though Homeric works aren't quite as emotionally affecting as the tragedies, they have enough of the elements to earn Aristotle's praise on the same structural grounds that the &lt;em &gt;Poetics &lt;/em &gt;describes. Note that he does briefly consider comedy and so may have room in his theory for multiple distinct criteria by which works could be appreciated, but if there was more of the text that considered comedy in more detail, it's been lost to history (though &lt;a href="http://www.strangehistory.net/2010/08/29/in-search-of-aristotles-on-comedy/" target="_blank"&gt;people are still looking for it &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes maintains that tragedy does offer a unique, psychologically central benefit to us: &lt;a href="https://psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/hanna-segal" target="_blank"&gt;Hanna Segal's &lt;/a &gt;"A Psycho-Analytical Approach to Aesthetics" (1947) describes how tragedy mimics the structure of human maturation, i.e. we lose the external trappings of parental care in the process of gaining internal autonomy, and engaging with this theatrical imitation feels good. So if this is so relieving, such a central aesthetic experience, we should see frequent use of it throughout history. Since modern entertainment doesn't seem to offer a lot of this (even our darker works don't tend to use quite this structure), this position entails that we (as a culture) have somehow lost touch with this central part of ourselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Alternately, maybe Aristotle's prescription is just unnecessarily narrow and elitist, and there are many ways to achieve catharsis through art that shows bad things happening, from the ubiquitous dystopian fiction that the kids love nowadays to the many tales of people being eaten by their bad actions (e.g. &lt;em &gt;Breaking Bad &lt;/em &gt;, &lt;em &gt;Mad Men &lt;/em &gt;, &lt;em &gt;Parasite &lt;/em &gt;, &lt;em &gt;Trainspotting &lt;/em &gt;), to the simple tragedy of people being beaten down by social structures, natural disasters, the malice of other men, or just bad luck. And however bad things get in these kinds of fictions, audiences tend to like when there is some sort of redemption or triumph or overcoming of the horrible things, some silver lining to the black cloud. Leaving things totally bleak is still considered edgy, perhaps appreciable only from the standpoint of dark comedy, which offers its own sort of catharsis.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2LknUVe" target="_blank"&gt;the very literal, heavily annotated translation &lt;/a &gt;by Benardete and Davis (this has a very good introduction).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ch. 4 of Lewis's book &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2V7Gfcw" target="_blank"&gt;Counterfactuals &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1973) and the essays “Scorekeeping in a Language Game” (1979) and “Truth in Fiction” (1978).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes counter-factual statements true? If you think "I might have grown up in Cleveland" is true, then what thing about the world makes that "might" statement true? Or by contrast "I might have been a round square" is not only obviously false, but it &lt;em &gt;can't &lt;/em &gt;be true. We could say that it's true that "it's impossible for a round square to exist," or to put the same point another way, "it's a necessary truth that nothing can be both round and square." Some philosophers going back to Leibniz have described these &lt;em &gt;modal &lt;/em &gt;notions of possibility and necessity in terms of possible worlds. Something is necessary (e.g. maybe 1+1=2) if the proposition expressing it is true in all possible worlds. Something is possible (might have been) if it's true in at least one world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This idea was formalized (meaning converted to logical symbols) by a different Lewis, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#Development_of_modal_logic" target="_blank"&gt;C.I. Lewis &lt;/a &gt;, near the beginning of the 20th century, and further developed by Rudolf Carnap, Saul Kripke, and others. David Lewis is perhaps best known for taking this notion metaphysically seriously, saying that possible worlds aren't just a metaphor but are metaphysically real. &lt;a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/elucidations/" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Teichman from the Elucidations podcast &lt;/a &gt;joins Mark, Wes, and Dylan to figure out what this might mean. Clearly Lewis doesn't mean that they're part of the "actual" world, i.e. our world. They're merely &lt;em &gt;possible &lt;/em &gt;. If you were living in one of those possible worlds (and technically, &lt;em &gt;you &lt;/em &gt;couldn't, i.e. the actual you; at best a counterpart of you could exist in a possible world), then you'd consider that world actual and ours merely possible. So while ordinary language considers "real" and "actually existing" to be synonymous, Lewis is separating those.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We do our best to use the work of our previous episodes to make sense of all of this. In considering first Quine's "On What There Is" in ep. 66 and then Carnap's response in "Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology" in ep. 191, we came across the idea that "to be is to be the value of a bound variable." This means that when we talk, we use expressions like "everything," and we should then look at what "things" are covered by that "everything" to decide what our ontology (the list of types of things that we think exist) is. So if you want to make statements about all numbers (and most mathematicians do!), then in some sense numbers have to be in your ontology, or maybe you have to engage in some elaborate reduction to show that (as an empiricist like Quine would prefer), no, numbers are just abstractions from macroscopic things in the actual world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lewis is just applying this insight about numbers to possible worlds. To do math, we need to talk about numbers. To use modal concepts like "possible" and "necessary," we need to talk about possible worlds (or more precisely, talking about possible worlds makes sense of the common-sense modal intuitions that result in us using these terms). Lewis considers various ways that possible-world-talk could be reduced to other sorts of talk (maybe a possible world is just a consistent set of propositions), but he finds those alternatives more problematic than just talking about possible worlds.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what is it to insist that talk of these worlds is not just irreducible to some other kind of talk, but possible worlds themselves are &lt;em &gt;real &lt;/em &gt;? What does "real" add to this? Reflecting on our series from 2018 on the notion of truth (starting with ep. 194), we decide that at least at this stage of Lewis's thinking, maybe we can say that saying it's "real" doesn't actually add anything to saying that it's a irreducible kind of talk. This is a &lt;em &gt;deflationary &lt;/em &gt;theory of what it is to be real (or true). For Tarski (and further, back to Frege), saying "it is raining" and "it is true that it is raining" are the same; "it is true that" adds nothing. So "we need to talk about possible worlds to make sense of our modal intuitions" and "we need to talk about possible worlds to make sense of our modal intuitions, and furthermore, possible worlds are real" are two sentences with the same logical content in them, even though they look different.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Note that in order to find possible world talk useful, you don't have to agree with Lewis about their metaphysical status. In the second half of our discussion, turning to primarily the "Scorekeeping in a Language Game" essay, we consider conversational dynamics, which in part involves thinking about how possible world talk relates to conversation. The whole point of talking about the "score" of a conversation is not to describe talking as competitive, but to say that there's a shared set of assumptions that we make as we proceed through a conversation, and this set of assumptions (like a score) can change as we go. Some of these assumptions can be described modally in terms of possible worlds. If we're thinking together about a scientific problem (considering the various possible worlds in which one or the other scientific hypothesis is true), we're not considering the possible worlds in which ghosts or the Divine Hand play some direct causal role. But if you suggest such a solution, and I agree to consider it, then the score has shifted, and we're now considering a much wider set of possible worlds.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lewis gives many examples of the parameters by which the context (the score) may shift, and for instance, we have another go at Austin's performatives as described in ep. 186. While Austin thinks that performatives have not truth value (and by extension, maybe all sentences are performative to some extent, and so truth is not as binary as we've been led to believe), Lewis thinks that uttering a performative changes the score of the conversation so as to, with the new context, make itself true. Before a religious official pronounces that "you are now married," the sentence (not yet uttered) would have been false, at the moment it is uttered (given appropriate circumstances), then it becomes a true sentence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In "Truth in Fiction," we're considering a specific type of possible world: one created by a writer. Lewis's example is Arthur Conan Doyle's world of Sherlock Holmes. "In the world of Sherlock Holmes" is a particular kind of modal operator, and according to modal logic, it shouldn't be possible for us to conclude things about the real world from statements about that fictive world, and vice versa, but yet we do, for instance, assume that Holmes doesn't have three nostrils, even though none of the stories explicitly mentions his number of nostrils. So that fictive world is not just all the possible worlds in which the things explicitly said in the text are true, but the closest world(s) to ours in which the text is true, meaning that unless he states something that diverges from our actual world, we can assume that what's true about our actual world is also true of the world the author is creating for us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So you can see how this shared context is related to scorekeeping in a conversation, and Lewis considers some interesting exceptions to the fictive world being like our actual one, as in if he and his audience share a wrong belief about the actual world, then that wrong belief will be part of the shared context: the fictive world will differ from the actual world in that it contains that error. And of course there are other ways that the author can make mistakes, like Watson's war wound isn't always described in the Holmes stories as being in the same place, yet clearly wounds like that don't move, and Doyle is not trying to give us a world of moving wounds. He just made a mistake, meaning that strictly speaking his world isn't "possible" any more than a round square is possible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2V7Gfcw" target="_blank"&gt;Counterfactuals &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/peter.verdee/counterfactuals/lewis.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Spirit of the Laws &lt;/em &gt;(1748) by Charles Louis de Secondat, aka Baron de Montesquieu.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What keeps a society functioning? Montesquieu, though of course not the first political philosopher, was perhaps the first to systematically explore correlations between characteristics of a government, its people, its climate, dominant industries, religion, and other factors. Like Aristotle, he explored republics, monarchies, and tyrannies. Like Machiavelli, he looked at what types of laws and policies work best for the type of government in question. Like John Locke, he argued for the separation of powers and as much liberty for citizens as is compatible with stability.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, Montesquieu was much less individualistic than Locke and Hobbes. He defines the civil state as what unites the individual wills of the populace. For a democratic republic like ours (of course he only had the ancient Greeks to reflect on, though he did have interesting things to say about the character of the American colonists), the "spring" of society—its motivating force—is virtue, defined as love of country. Democracy decays when the citizens put themselves above country, voting in their narrow self-interest. In particular, he thought that the mass of poor would vote to divide up the wealth of the country among themselves. Individual citizens aren't competent to decide actual policies, Montesquieu argued, but they are able to pick out who in their local jurisdiction is wise enough to represent them. For aristocracies (a type of republic where a particular class rules instead of the whole populace), the virtue that the leaders need is moderation: They need to love their country enough to, again, put its interest above their own, and not press down too hard on the reset of the populace.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A constitutional monarchy runs not on virtue but on honor. The aristocrats serve to counter-balance the king, and so the aristocracy needs to be kept strong, e.g., you don't allow inheritances to be widely split. The nobles will behave because their honor commands that they do, and likewise the king fears the dishonor that would delegitimize his rule in the eyes of the nobles and the people. So in this case, as with Adam Smith's invisible hand, each noble by pursuing the honor that he takes to be his self-interest ends up strengthening the state. This is much easier to engineer than a democracy of virtuous citizens. Still, there's room for corruption, and as with a republic, a corrupt monarchy slides toward despotism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Montesquieu was no fan of despotism, but he had recommendations for how a despotic regime can be more stable. A tyranny runs on fear, both of the despot (whose power must be absolute) and of each other (so that they want the despot to protect them from other people). The first rule of despotism is that a ruler who is not himself ruled by honor or religion (which acts as a tempering agent in some despotic regimes) will not be interested in the business of ruling, so he'll appoint a grand vizier to do all the real work while he just pursues endless pleasures. This puts the vizier (among others) in a position to potentially take over, so tyrannies tend to be unstable and tend to collapse into other tyrannies as the state is passed from hand to hand.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On top of this type of analysis of the internal functioning of different types of state is Montesquieu's (admittedly very crude) analysis of the effect of climate on people's habits and constitution. In short, he thought that being in the hot south makes people more lazy, sensitive, passionate, and slavish; while living in the cold north makes one strong, less sensitive to pain and emotion, and more conservative (i.e., virtuous). This makes those hot areas more prone to tyranny, slavery, theocracy, polygamy, and other practices that keep people in line. The people there, Montesquieu thought, are actually suited to those conditions, and democracy (for instance) is unlikely to among them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Liberty, for Montesquieu, is not the freedom to do whatever one wants, but is first and foremost a matter of feeling safe. It involves living under laws that protect us while leaving us free to do as much as possible with confidence that if we obey the laws, we won't incur the ire of the state. The chief guarantee of liberty is the separation of powers, and he talked a lot about England with its constitutional monarchy that created separate chambers representing the nobles and the common people, with the juries that decide individual cases pulled from peers of the accused. The architects of the American constitution took quite a bit of his advice, from the idea that the ruler should be able to only veto but not craft laws, from impeachment as requiring the lower house to bring charges and the upper house to decide them, to geographical representation and the executive being head of the military.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But among all these familiar details is a framework that is very strange, not only regarding his weird and wrong analysis regarding climate (which is in effect very racist even though he's saying that environment is at fault, not racial character), but the whole system is wrapped up in a pretty pious idea of morality in nature itself that dictates what good law and proper behavior between states ("right of nations") should amount to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/33CEgRn" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or try &lt;a href="https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/montesquieu/spiritoflaws.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth snuggle into our enforced social distancing to give our thoughts (and some of yours) on our recent string of episodes on social construction (starting with #227), especially regarding gender (see #232 and #235). We also never had a critical debrief after speaking to Judith Butler in #236, so we consider whether her notion of "grievable lives" adds helpfully to our moral lexicon.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This was intended to be a "mailbag" episode, and we read a couple of listener comments. Have we in fact "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hermesianax/status/1231978768048304128" target="_blank"&gt;lost our credibility &lt;/a &gt;" by delving this far into identity politics?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Benjamin's "Critique of Violence" (1921).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is violence? &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin" target="_blank"&gt;Walter Benjamin &lt;/a &gt;(pronounced "Ben-Ya-Meen") breaks down the phenomenon into four types and then shows why these are not really distinct after all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;First, any state is always established, he says, through at least some violent acts, so this is law-making violence. Not only does one group subdue another, but then everyone signs a treaty or constitution or something to ratify that subdual.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Second, once you have a state, that state defends itself through retaining a monopoly on legitimate violence. The police, the courts, the military all practice law-preserving violence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In practice, these can blur together. The police in particular, for the sake of "keeping the peace," regularly exceed the mere enforcement of existing law, besides which, all laws are general and need to be interpreted to apply to particular, concrete situations. Benjamin says that they're really practicing law-making violence of a sort as well.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The third type is mythical violence, such as when in Greek mythology, some haughty mortal brags about being superior to the gods in some respect (Benjamin mentions &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Niobe-Greek-mythology" target="_blank"&gt;Niobe &lt;/a &gt;) and is then stricken. Benjamin analyzes this not as the gods trying to maintain some code of conduct, and so punishing those who contravene it, but as gods showing off their power. This, says Benjamin, actually provides the model for state power too. While a government might declare that it's merely keeping its citizens' behavior within certain bounds for their own good, the fact that this is backed by a threat of violence reveals the ultimate game: It's about the state asserting its own power. Power backed by violence in fact has its own dynamic, its own force; there's a self-perpetuating character intrinsic to violence that subsumes any leaders' attempt to use violence as a "mere means" to its ends.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This attempt to use means-ends analysis to evaluate violence is for Benjamin the whole problem with traditional analyses. We think that if the end is good (e.g., this is a "just war"), then violence is a legitimate option to pursue that end. We might even think that an agreement without an (ultimately, eventually violent) enforcement mechanism is just a piece of paper not worth anything. But Benjamin is arguing (pretty obliquely) that this voluntary, unenforceable agreement is really the best we can get, that our salvation lies in verbal communication and social, non-violent sanctions. He had been reading a bunch of anarchists at this point (he's chiefly reacting to Georges Sorel's 1908 book &lt;em &gt;Reflections on Violence &lt;/em &gt;), but does not tell us in this essay what kind of society he's actually shooting for here. His critique is negative: There is something rotten at the core of all existing governments, and that something is the violence inherent in the system.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The fourth type of violence provides what Benjamin takes to be a limit case, and his explanation here has confounded commentators including us. He distinguishes from the mythological violence described above "divine violence," which he describes as expiating (atoning for) sin: "pure power over all life for the sake of the living." Benjamin's philosopher's God, which like that of &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/06/04/ep165-spinoza-bible-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Spinoza &lt;/a &gt;does not exhibit human-like qualities like the gods of mythology do, punishes to educate: Thou shalt not [whatever the prohibition is], and if you do, this is what happens to you. The punishment becomes so impersonal that it's no longer punishment, but just cause and effect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Benjamin sees this kind of violence as transcending means-end analysis because it's not about cementing god's power; it's essentially an act of nature itself, but with a moral dimension. So why isn't this just a bit of theology that we can ignore? Why is this relevant to serious political philosophy? Well, for the record, in Benjamin's later work, he dismisses this whole notion as a mere limit case, disconnected from practical matters, so maybe we shouldn't sweat too much over this, but let's play along for the moment. He uses the idea of a strike to illustrate what this "limit" amounts to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In an ordinary workers' strike, the workers abrogate some of the state's power. They stop working and make some demands, and while the state could just permit them all to be fired and replaced, on Benjamin's analysis the state doesn't do this out of fear of insurrection. The workers are essentially extorting benefits out of their employers, and the state permits this out of fear for its own survival. So a strike, even one where the workers are just nonviolently refraining from work, like a law, is ultimately backed by the threat of violence. When the workers get what they want, they go back to work. Some amount of power has passed from one elite group (the bosses/the state) to another elite group (the union).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The more widespread the strike, the more extortion is involved. A general workers' strike makes it impossible for people (who would benefit from the workers' service) to attain what's necessary to live. But what if the explicit goal of the strike was not to attain some particular benefits, some particular transfer of power, but to unseat the state altogether, so that the result was not merely transfer of power from one (underlyingly) despotic state to another (as in the case of the French Revolution) but to a stateless future? This kind of strike, which would likely involve both implicit and explicit violence, Benjamin imagines could be seen as comparable to divine violence. It would redeem us. The problem (and again, this is Benjamin talking in later works about this idea) is that no would-be revolutionaries would actually know that this is the kind of revolution they're actually engaged in. It's only from a later, historical perspective that a particular revolution could be identified as having been violent in this divine (as opposed to merely mythological) manner.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We picked this essay because it's discussed explicitly by Judith Butler in her book &lt;em &gt;The Force of Nonviolence &lt;/em &gt;discussed on our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2020/02/24/ep236-butler-nonviolence/" target="_blank"&gt;previous episode &lt;/a &gt;. She advises that we just ignore the part about divine violence and focus on first, the fact that what counts as "violent" or not depends on a certain social frame, so that a state will call any act that threatens its power violent even if there's no physical fighting involved. Second, following Benjamin, Butler thinks we can always choose nonviolence, that any lasting accord is going to be one that is truly voluntary, that we can't preclude violent violation through a violence-backed agreement, but that instead it's our word that provides the only—albeit very imperfect—tool we have for advancing productive cooperation and peaceful coexistence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy the essay in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674013557/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674013557 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a43af877754944a711b51e45673b0072" target="_blank"&gt;Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, 1: 1913–1926 &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="http://joshualubinlevy.com/uploads/3/5/3/6/35367669/walter-benjamin-critique-of-violence-2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We mention two secondary sources (beyond the Butler book) that help situate the essay within Benjamin's body of work (this was early; he later became more explicitly Marxist) and provide some interpretation for the very difficult end of the essay: "&lt;a href="http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/10/11/notes-thought-walter-benjamin-critique-violence/" target="_blank"&gt;Notes on the Thought of Walter Benjamin: Critique of Violence &lt;/a &gt;" by Signe Larsen and "&lt;a href="https://anthropologicalmaterialism.hypotheses.org/1040" target="_blank"&gt;Towards a Politics of 'Pure Means': Walter Benjamin and the Question of Violence &lt;/a &gt;" by Sami Khatib.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Jericho" from hackedepiciotto, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem116-hackedepicciotto/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #116 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind &lt;/em &gt;(2020).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is it to be nonviolent in political activity? Is it to eschew violence in all circumstances, or just not to be the aggressor? While Judith is not ruling out all excuses that violence is needed for self-defense, she sees this excuse as perniciously expansive due to the nature of what we might consider part of "self." First, she gives a comprehensive critique of individualism: Contra &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/06/07/episode-3-hobbess-leviathan-the-social-contract/" target="_blank"&gt;Hobbes &lt;/a &gt;, we are not free-floating atoms who then deign to enter into social relations, but are born and remain dependent and interconnected, not just to our immediate family but to the larger environment and to humanity as a whole. One implication for this is that the primary way that philosophers typically think about ethics, as a matter of an individual faced with a moral choice, should not really be our starting point, and the fact that we think this way is a phenomenon that begs psychological-historical investigation. Ethical thought is fundamentally political: What kind of world do we want? What kind of ethical goals in setting up our laws and customs (and &lt;em &gt;within &lt;/em &gt;this framework, acting as individuals toward one another) really acknowledge our interconnectedness, our fundamental moral equality?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whatever Hobbes may say, we do in fact think about "self" in an expanded sense: My self-interest is not just this body, but extends to what is important to me, to my family, to my friends, to those I can identify with, i.e., those "like me." As a nation, we might then insist that "America [come] First," meaning that those who are not on our team are not part of our circle of concern, are not what Judith calls "grievable lives." We might even imagine an invasion of these unwanted people is threatening us, that they are coming to take away what we need to survive and thrive, and thus commit violence preemptively in defense of this extended self that we call our nation, or ethnic group, or social class.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One of the problems with nonviolence, then, is that what actions count as violent are socially constructed, i.e., are determined within a political frame. Though violence typically involves "the blow," clearly an armed or otherwise impenetrable (for practical purposes) barrier set between some group of people and the basic necessities of survival should be considered violent. And this self-defensive logic means that a society will consider "violent" anything that it takes as threatening to its existence, even if that takes the place of a peaceful protest (which might turn violent, they say). Individual members of marginalized groups may be perceived as inherently violent, as when trigger-ready police perceive someone as a criminal type, as a credible threat even when in reality unarmed and running away. And societies will consider their "defensive" maneuvers as not truly violent, not in the objectionable sense.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Judith thinks that a true acknowledgement of our human equality would involve treating all lives as grievable. This doesn't mean that each of us must cry over the death of anyone in the world, no matter how remote, but we must regard those lives as worthy of protecting, because something incalculable would be lost if even one of those lives was lost. There is no moral defense for regarding only those like us as requiring that we construct society so as to protect them and regarding others as just too much, as necessarily beyond our circle of concern. It is a linguistic frame that enables us to have a concept like "collateral damage" that regards some losses as acceptable.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In addition to this acknowledgement of the total nature of our interconnectedness, of the universality of our true circle of concern, Judith wants us to recognize that within any circumscription of the self, there is conflict, there is a plurality of entities united by a bond that is fraught, that is ambivalent, that has the potential to explode into violence, and the choice of nonviolence is only meaningful in light of that ever-present temptation toward violence. This should be clear enough in the case of families and neighbors, where closeness can and does result in clashes, but it's also true even within the skin of one individual. According to Freud (Judith's book discusses the Freudian Melanie Klein extensively on this point), as part of our development we internalize the objects of our affection. First and foremost, when the mother stops being ever-present to her baby, that baby creates a sort of mother-object within his or her psyche, which will then be subject to rage (because the mother is gone), guilt (about that rage), need and affection, resentment (about that need), etc. All love involves hate, all need involves resentment and rage at the present of need, and we need to channel that rage and hate somehow. Judith recommends not passivity but forceful non-violence, or what Gandhi calls &lt;em &gt;Satyagraha &lt;/em &gt;, "polite insistence on the truth." The goal of this type of political action is conversion, not coercion, and it's communication and respecting even a hated other as a grievable equal that provides a real contrast to violence. Though she does not insist on an absolute avoidance of violence in all circumstances, the moral goal should be to recognize the potential for violence at each moment and to choose otherwise.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, and Wes interview Judith here as a follow-up to our discussion of her earlier book, &lt;em &gt;Gender Trouble &lt;/em &gt;(1990), and we tried to connect the two works, as both are about forming an identity and draw heavily on psychoanalysis in giving explanations of how this takes place. We learn that Judith is our first guest to have been burnt in effigy; this was over her stance on gender, which as an example of the warped self-defense logic described above, has been taken as an attack on humanity itself. The attack on individualism also serves to help us understand the upshot of that book: Its point was not that each of us can artistically just choose to break tradition and display whatever gender performance we want; it was a challenge to an unjust binary system that regarded those non-conforming as outside of legitimate humanity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In ep. 237 we'll be considering Walter Benjamin's 1921 essay "Critique of Violence," which provides key inspiration for this book; in the latter half of that episode we give Butler's interpretation of Benjamin to supplement the current discussion. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2T6YvSl" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

Is gender socially constructed, and if so, how?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Butler describes gender not as an essential quality of a person, but as "performed," as habits of acting in certain ways in accordance with customs. But it's not that we can simply recognize that customs could have been different and so throw out gender concepts. Gender is part of how we identify something as human at all and is tied up with our self-conceptions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism" target="_blank"&gt;post-structuralist &lt;/a &gt;, Butler believes that the circle of language and culture makes up how we perceive and conceptualize the world, that in fact there is no raw, uninterpreted nature (at least not one that could have anything to do with our knowledge) that we then use language and culture to interpret, but that our world is just language and culture all the way down. This means that the model of gender as socially constructed is &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;one where there's this brute physical fact, biological sex, which culture then comes along and inscribes gender on, but instead we perceive the physical as split into binary sexual categories because we already have gender concepts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though Butler's book is seen as a foundational text for queer theory, rejecting as it does the naturalness of masculinity and femininity as they're traditionally conceived, it provides a puzzle as to what practical action to take to break out of these binary conceptions, given how globally culture controls our thinking. Our past guest Martha Nussbaum attacked the book in a 1999 article as divorced from concrete political action, and given that Butler doesn't believe in a self-experienced "true gender" that might differ from one's biological sex, it's not obvious how to apply her insights to the situation of a trans* person.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One of the first issues Butler deals with in the book is the effect that problematizing the notion of gender might have on feminism. She says that feminists (like Beauvoir) often take as a starting point for feminism that there is a discretely defined group "women" who have common experiences and a common situation of oppression. But what about non-binary folks? Butler thinks that one can have a liberating political coalition without artificially imposing a unity on all feminists.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As the discussion proceeds, we get into the different views of femininity within male-defined conceptual space according to Beauvoir (for whom the female is defined as the lack of male attributes) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Irigaray" target="_blank"&gt;Luce Irigaray &lt;/a &gt;(for whom even this "lack" is another aspect of maleness, with the feminine literally unspeakable, i.e. there's no room for it at all in our current scheme). Another go-to figure for Butler is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monique_Wittig" target="_blank"&gt;Monique Wittig &lt;/a &gt;, whose analysis labeled compulsory heterosexuality (in the service of propagation of the species) as the primary force driving the creation of binary gender concepts. She also talks about Foucault, on three counts: First, in his &lt;em &gt;History of Sexuality &lt;/em &gt;, he gives a picture of humanity as natively pansexual, but then "The Law" comes and creates a structure by which both (approved) heterosexuality and (forbidden) homosexuality are articulated. Second, he adapted Nietzsche's idea of philosophy as genealogy to its modern form, which Butler says is her goal in this book even though her story of the origins of gender lacks the concrete historical detail that fills Foucault's books. Finally, Butler talks a lot about Foucault's introduction to the memoir of Herculine Barbin, a "Nineteenth Century French Hermaphrodite," which demonstrated for Foucault a gender identity less wholly determined by--in fact, in explicit conflict with--social norms than is the case for most people. Butler uses all of these other figures as dialectical steps in her critique: They all have something right and worth articulating in them but are then in turn critiqued for not seeing all the logical conclusions of their views.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This discussion continues to include &lt;a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/people/jennifer-hansen" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Hansen &lt;/a &gt;from our Simone de Beauvoir episodes. We all read the two prefaces (one of which was added in 1999 and responds to some of the objections raised by Nussbaum), all of part I, "Subjects of Sex/Gender/Desire," part III, section iv: "Subversive Bodily Acts: Bodily Inscriptions, Performative Subversions," and the conclusion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2SaUrA4" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;. We also found these earlier articles by Butler very helpful: "&lt;a href="http://seas3.elte.hu/coursematerial/TimarAndrea/17a.Butler,performative%5B1%5D.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Performative Acts and Gender Constitution &lt;/a &gt;" (1988) and "&lt;a href="https://programaddssrr.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sex-and-gender-in-simone-de-beauvoirs-second-sex.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Sex and Gender in Simone de Beauvoir's Second Sex &lt;/a &gt;" (1986). For a more confident and detailed argument for the thesis that biological sex is socially constructed (in the current book it's more raised as a question), try her subsequent book, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2v6K1cx" target="_blank"&gt;Bodies That Matter &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1993).

We recognize that contrary to expectations, this text and our discussion of it does not treat the social construction of gender in a manner that adequately deals with current trans* debates, and we'd like to either (very soon) hold a "Second Opinions" session (&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/08/28/ep170-3-debord/" target="_blank"&gt;like we did for Marxism &lt;/a &gt;), or else we'll just have to cover this more explicitly at some future point (probably not soon). We've been emailing folks about this for weeks with no takers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Simone De Beauvoir’s &lt;em &gt;The Second Sex &lt;/em &gt;(1949): "The Woman in Love" and "Myths" with guest &lt;a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/people/jennifer-hansen" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Hansen &lt;/a &gt;. We explore the maladies of love, try a little to figure how B's picture relates to modern romance and what her positive prescription for good love is, and use the recent film &lt;em &gt;A Marriage Story &lt;/em &gt;as a case study.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-232-simone-de-32705616" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 232 &lt;/a &gt;laid out Beauvoir's picture of the Othered Woman, deprived of agency and hence pretty f'ed up. Now we consider the consequences of this situation for romantic love. In "The Woman in Love" (vol. 2, part III, ch. 12), we get a psychological picture of the typically asymmetrical character of romantic relationships (note that "love" in this strong sense is rarer than one might think; many marriages don't involve the intense dynamic she describes): The woman, having no projects of her own, surrenders herself totally, raising her lover to divine status, trying in effect to be a Subject by living through him. The man, on the other hand, however much he may exhibit passion in the chase, once he has her, has other projects to focus on. He doesn't need her as much as she needs him and will find her demands for constant attention intrusive. He also can't live up to being deified, so she'll inevitably end up frustrated and is likely to cheat and exhibit stereotypically shrewish behaviors. Love is a woman's attempt, on Beauvoir's view, to balance her eroticism (orienting herself outward) and her narcissism (orienting inward, trying to maintain a self in the face of patriarchy that tries to crush her): She's willing to undergo the humiliation of self-surrender if only her lover can then give her reality and life through his gaze. This is inherently unstable.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In "Myths" (vol. 1, part III, ch. 1), we find out what men (commonly, under patriarchy) seek from love. Given that they're not virtual slaves, you'd think that they'd be less neurotic, but no, they suffer from more general existential maladies. Consciousness, as Sartre's book &lt;em &gt;Being and Nothingness &lt;/em &gt;indicates, is nothingness, since we "are" not anything in particular. So we seek to solidly become something real and stable in the world, and this primarily through the gaze of other people. But per Hegel's master-and-slave picture of human interaction, this is hard to achieve with an equal; our first instinct on meeting another self-consciousness is to fight, to dominate, to get that person's wretched gaze off of us. What we really want is to be seen, to be recognized, but in a positive light. Man wants to be judged, but not really honestly judged; we want to be judged as good. Woman, as a sort-of person, can serve this role.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So why is this chapter called "Myths"? Because men have made religion, because it's men's neuroses and their attitudes towards women that get writ large in cultural archetypes. So if Jordan Peterson says that Man is archetypically order and Woman is archetypically chaos, that's a description of men's fears. Because though woman on the scheme Beauvoir is describing can "complete" man (or so he thinks), she's also fickle, like nature that can give life through bounteous harvests but also tear up those harvests through catastrophic storms. Another aspect of man's attempt at self-hood is that he defines himself as a transcendent freedom, as essentially a Cartesian spirit that can overcome its embodiment to make truly free choices. Now, this should sound like it accurately reflects Sartre's (and so Beauvoir's) existentialist take on the human condition, but patriarchy has made this too literal. Man has identified himself as spiritual in opposition to the fleshy Other, to the Mother from whence he came, to Nature that he thinks he's risen to be apart from. When he muses about what Woman is, he gets a bunch of contradictory images of saint and demon, peace and roaring chaos, nurturing and smothering. These are all largely projections, and this chapter goes into great detail about mythical images of Womanhood, taboos surrounding menstruation and birth, and the kind of origin-rejecting psychology that we discussed in our Kristeva episodes (you might recall we even explicitly connected this to Lovecraftian horror).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also looked at Beauvoir's chapter "The Lesbian" (vol. 2, part I, ch. 4) to see what Beauvoir thought love might be like among equals. As an existentialist, you know she's going to say that being gay is a choice, since everything about ourselves is a choice, whatever the "situation" of our bodies and desires may be. She thinks that it's not surprising that women should be attracted to each other, since before social norms kick in, it makes sense that everyone should be attracted to everyone else. What's different about the lesbian is that she refuses the situation of submitting herself to men. And yes, since there are no socially dictated roles defining how the lovers in a lesbian relationship are supposed to act toward each other, there's more honesty and ease in such relationships, but she thinks they're not generally as intense and epic as the religiously fraught heterosexual relationships described above, and they're still indirectly polluted by patriarchy and of course subject to existential ailments. Her account is interesting but problematic enough that we didn't discuss it; our purpose in adding it was to prepare us for ep. 235, where Jenny rejoins us to discuss Judith Butler's &lt;em &gt;Gender Trouble &lt;/em &gt;, which uses Beauvoir as a primary starting point.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2s0r36z" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or try &lt;a href="https://uberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1949_simone-de-beauvoir-the-second-sex.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this version someone posted online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Easier than Leaving" by Michaela Anne, whose &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music &lt;/a &gt;interview will be released soon as episode 114.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If we have any trans* philosopher (or podcaster or other representative or commentator of some sort) who might want to contribute feedback in some form to our next episode on Butler's &lt;em &gt;Gender Trouble &lt;/em &gt;, please &lt;a href="mailto:mark@partiallyexaminedlife.com?Subject=Butler" target="_blank"&gt;contact Mark &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Please consider contributing to the Leukemia/Lymphoma Society through Mina Linsenmayer's campaign.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the Platonic dialogue written around 380 BCE about an encounter between Socrates and one of the leading Sophists of his day.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is virtue ("the political art" according to Protagoras), and can it be taught? What are the relations of the various virtues to each other? Do they really amount ultimately to one and the same thing, i.e. wisdom?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For once in a Platonic dialogue, Socrates' opponent is given quite a lot to say, and says it pretty well, so the first half of our discussion largely concentrates on Protagoras' long speech arguing that yes, the thing that he claims to teach can in fact be taught. After all, isn't the whole process of socialization about teaching kids to be good citizens?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Socrates, though, doesn't like such long speeches, and threatens to just go home if Protagoras won't play his question-and-answer game instead, after which Socrates immediately gives a long speech himself, perhaps in parody of the Sophistical style. He then uses the "are all the virtues really one thing?" question to prove that Protagoras doesn't really know what virtue is, and so probably shouldn't claim to teach it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The dialogue ends in a tangle: Socrates has been arguing that all virtue comes down to wisdom. Even courage, which seems like it could be a virtue of some seriously dumb people, isn't really courage qua virtue (as opposed to mere boldness, foolhardiness) unless it's a sensible reaction to real threats, which involves knowledge of those threats. But if virtue is really knowledge, doesn't that mean it's teachable after all? So Socrates ends (as he admits, befuddled) arguing for the position that he had started off the dialogue by doubting.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You won't find much of the "man is the measure of all things" Protagoras here; this is all about ethics, not epistemology (that famous slogan of Protagoras is considered in a not-very-charitable way in Plato's &lt;em &gt;Theaetetus &lt;/em &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Make It Clear" by Feelies; Mark interviewed Glenn Mercer on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem-41-glenn-mercer-feelies-produce-yourself/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #41 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Simone De Beauvoir’s &lt;em &gt;The Second Sex &lt;/em &gt;(1949): the intro, conclusion, “Woman’s Situation and Character,” and parts of “Lived Experience," with guest &lt;a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/people/jennifer-hansen" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Hansen &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to Beauvoir, Woman (the "kept" woman of history that was still common in her time and not unheard of now) is conceived of by society (and hence by herself) as "Other." Men created society, own all the property, and get to make the decisions. A woman's life revolves around marriage and child-bearing; she doesn't get to have any freely chosen projects and thus never gets to participate as a Subject in the existential quandaries of existence. She's already defined as an object, as a thing-in-itself. This 800-page text goes into great detail about the situation of women and about the historical-cultural factors behind it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We get into the existential/Hegelian analysis of this situation, into her use of Freudian developmental explanations (well, she's actually reacting against Freud by insisting that gender differences result from social forces, not biology, but talking about child development in a vaguely Freudian way is still relevant), the source of stereotypes of women, and what might be involved with addressing the more damaging differences in the way boys and girls are brought up.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We read the Borde/Malovany-Chevallier translation, which you can &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2s0r36z" target="_blank"&gt;purchase &lt;/a &gt;or try &lt;a href="https://uberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1949_simone-de-beauvoir-the-second-sex.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this version someone posted online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The sections we read using that edition are:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;1.

Unlike the unpublished &lt;em &gt;Rules for Direction of the Mind &lt;/em &gt;(1629), this text doesn't actually dwell on his method at length, though it includes a distillation of the rules: Include in your judgments only what is presented clearly and distinctly to the mind, divide problems into the smallest possible parts, and direct your thoughts in an orderly manner through those parts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;By this point it actually seems that he thinks the method is better demonstrated than explained, and he includes within this text a detailed account of the physiology of the heart (which most philosophy readers skip), and the text was published as the preface to three scientific essays meant to demonstrate this method in the areas of geometry, optics, and meteorology.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The text starts off with the story of his education and how his dissatisfaction with the uncertainty of what he'd been taught drove him to a personal re-evaluation, whereby he decided to temporarily set aside all his beliefs to look for a solid foundation for them. He then lays out a provisional ethical code to follow while performing this analysis, so that he wouldn't be without practical guidance. This code is conservative (obey society's laws) and stoic (try to change yourself instead of the world) and describes a good state of mind for doing science without distractions. He then leads us in short form through most of the steps that would later make up the &lt;em &gt;Meditations &lt;/em &gt;. Though that book was published after this, he describes the actual meditative process as having happened earlier, when he first moved to Amsterdam in 1628. It's actually this text, and not &lt;em &gt;The Meditations &lt;/em &gt;, that contains Descartes's famous maxim "I think, therefore I am."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's missing from this version of his reasoning is the step where he argues that since God is not a deceiver, then he wouldn't lie to us about all the scientific observations that seem so certain. In this text, scientific claims are left as defeasible, as merely probable, much less certain than truths grasped by the understanding, which can never in itself guarantee the existence of anything in the external world. It can, however, according to Descartes, guarantee the existence of a thinking thing (himself) and then of God, via Descartes's knowledge of his own lack and hence of some perfection (God) that must contains what he lacks. This is Descartes's version of the ontological argument (which we discuss in detail in episode 43), which is still bad, but makes somewhat more sense in light of his discussion of "simples" in the &lt;em &gt;Rules &lt;/em &gt;: If the idea of God is a simple (like the idea of length), then merely by understanding what that term means, we understand all of God's necessary properties, so (according to Descartes) we understand His perfection and His existence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This text includes more descriptions of (or references to) arguments than actual argumentation. Also during the pre-&lt;em &gt;Meditations &lt;/em &gt;section, he claims that because he's proven that he exists based on the observation that he's thinking, therefore he's also proven that he is essentially a thinking thing that is fundamentally different than his body and could live on without that. Again, if he thinks of the soul as a simple, then once he's shown that we do grasp it via grasping our own thoughts, then he thinks he knows everything essential about it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;And how does he know that the soul and God are simple ideas? Because he grasps them that way using clear and distinct perception. And what guarantees that what the understanding grasps clearly and distinctly is actually true? Ultimately, God, but he can't really use that here on pain of circularity: Descartes can't both claim that God grounds reason and reason grounds God (this is the "Cartesian circle"). In both this text and the &lt;em &gt;Rules &lt;/em &gt;, he treats the veracity of clear and distinct ideas as just given in our experience as a fundamental intuition. To deny it is to deny thought altogether. In the &lt;em &gt;Discourse &lt;/em &gt;, he explicitly founds this realization on the observation "I think, therefore I am." He sees that he understands this clearly and distinctly, and that that's what guarantees its truth, so he uses this as an exemplar of the general epistemic principle. (If you remember our &lt;em &gt;Rules &lt;/em &gt;discussion, this use of a single exemplar to prove a general point of reason is what Descartes weirdly calls "induction.")&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Descartes spends the final part of the &lt;em &gt;Discourse &lt;/em &gt;describing his concern with being thought a heretic in light of what happened to Galileo, and so why he hadn't published his big book &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(Descartes)" target="_blank"&gt;The World &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which had been done by 1633, but which he was just dribbling a bit out in the rest of this volume (i.e., the geometry, optics, and meteorology). He thinks about whether he wants to be a public intellectual or whether he should just let his works be published after his death. On the one hand, his method of scientific inquiry requires a lot of help by other people to perform experiments for him, but on the other hand, he says that he hasn't so far found the critiques of others valuable and would rather just be left alone to do his work.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The version most of us read was in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052128807X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=052128807X &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=bdb4a30ee98d75cbe11436b831560252" target="_blank"&gt;The Philosophical Writings of Descartes &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, translated by Robert Stoothoff, but there are several versions you can &lt;a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/descartes1637.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read for free online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "My Real Fantasy" By Joe Louis Walker, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem110-joe-louis-walker/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #110 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

There are no explosions or any other sort of spectacle; no superpowers; and nothing of the forces of good triumphing over evil. It’s a depressing character study of a depressed person who loses his last tenuous connections to reality and succumbs to criminal insanity. It’s also a film that has irritated socially conscious critics, who have tried to convince the public that the film is at the same time &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/14/20906190/joker-film-controversy-discussion" target="_blank"&gt;boring &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/movies/joker-review.html" target="_blank"&gt;shallow &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/joker-is-a-viewing-experience-of-rare-numbing-emptiness" target="_blank"&gt;racially insensitive &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/08/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix" target="_blank"&gt;unduly sympathetic to white people &lt;/a &gt;. In the lead-up to the release of the film, there was a good deal of media speculation about whether the film might inspire the next mass shooting.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Instead of manufacturing—depending on one’s proclivities—murderousness, boredom, or offense—the film has done something quite surprising, given its subject matter and form. It seems to have inspired in many—and I think terpsichorean pilgrimages to Queens are a good indication here—an experience that I think is rare for moviegoers today: joy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There are, I think, a set of interrelated reasons for this. They are, in sum, as follows: The film is psychologically true, and that this psychological truth is expertly performed by Joaquin Phoenix. This truth is conveyed viscerally—and I think this is the most compelling thing about the film—by the use of dance. Through it, the audience is given something that is rare in big budget films today: the opportunity to enjoy tragedy and identify deeply with a social outcast and villain. In doing this, it successfully exploits the relationship between humor and violence, and comedy and tragedy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I discussed some of these ideas in a conversation with Dr. William Sharp (psychoanalyst and &lt;a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/william-sharp/" target="_blank"&gt;professor at Northeastern &lt;/a &gt;) and the audience at the &lt;a href="https://bgsp.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis &lt;/a &gt;on November 22, 2019.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Latour's &lt;em &gt;We Have Never Been Modern &lt;/em &gt;(1993) with guest &lt;a href="https://www.unr.edu/english/people/lynda-olman" target="_blank"&gt;Lynda Olman &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the "modern" ideology of science, and is there something we should critique about it? Latour wants us to think about science not abstractly through the eternal truths it supposedly discovers, but through the concrete practices of scientists. This means acknowledging the phenomenology of science: It may well be that there's a totally objective, human-independent world that scientists are trying to get at, but their actual products are a mixture of nature and culture, or what Latour calls a "hybrid."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In talking about hybrids, Latour is referring to both the ideas that science comes up with (like the idea of a quark, a particular extrapolation from some data involving particle colliders and things; Andrew Pickering's &lt;em &gt;Constructing Quarks &lt;/em &gt;tells a long story about the contingent historical circumstances that caused scientists to develop that particular conception) and technological objects that science develops, like computers, whose political component is partly a matter of how it changes our lives.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Latour describes "modernity" as an era characterized by a Constitution, which is conceptually a thing like Hobbes's social contract. It's a set of interlocking ideas that we've implicitly agreed to insofar as we're still enacting modernity, and as the title of this book indicates, he thinks we've never really wholly bought into this Constitution.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Constitution primarily involves a strict separation of the scientific from the political. Science is objective; it's about us discovering things in the mind-independent world, and while yes, scientists have biases, these can be set aside so that we can get at truths that anyone who does the research should be able to agree on. On the other hand, the political is entirely our group creation: There are no divinely appointed monarchs, just structures that we've created, whether by centralized design or by a series of uncoordinated actions by individuals.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So what's wrong with these two claims? First, if nature really were something entirely separate from us, it would be alien and hostile; we couldn't do anything with it. No, science has always been not just about discovering objective truth, but about human utility. On the side of politics, if leadership were really a pure extension of our group will, then that would be an unrestricted, whimsical democracy. Instead, we posit some things like "rights" as if they were God-given. Both science and politics mix the objective and group-subjectivity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Latour thinks that this Constitutional myth of modernity whereby science and politics are kept separate has on the one been very productive in allowing science to advance, and thus (ironically) technological hybrids to proliferate. By denying that hybrids exist, it actually encourages more hybrids. However, this willful ignorance has its down-side: Scientists ignore the probable social effects of their creations, from the atom bomb to the emissions that have caused climate change to the throngs of people that we have saved with our medical but also removed the need for by automating away their jobs.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One parallel that comes up in the discussion: Mill's ideas on free speech are very much the product of modernity. He believed that we can separate out a forum for the free exchange of ideas (like the exchange between scientists) from different, overtly political speech acts like bullying and hate speech. A more sophisticated view (in Latour's view) would recognize that these can never be fully separated, and our codes of conduct need to recognize this (a la Fish in our free speech episode).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite all impressions, Latour insists that he's not a relativist, and he has nothing but contempt for post-modernism. His solution as outlined at the end of the book is a modified contract that keeps most of the benefits of modernism but does not insist on its myth-driven abstractions. We want technology, but we want careful scrutiny of its social effects. Extreme social constructionists set no bounds for the way our concepts could have been mapped out, but Latour acknowledges that much of what science deals with is "resistant" (this is his phenomenological way of saying "objective") to our attempts at re-interpretation or denial. He uses the term "quasi-object" to describe something that's "more more social, much more fabricated, much more collective than the 'hard' parts of nature, but they are in no way the arbitrary receptacles of a full-fledged society... They are much more real, nonhuman and objective than thoseshapeless screens on which society - for unknown reasons - needed to be 'projected'." (p. 55).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You might remember Lynda from when her last name was Walsh, and she appeared with us on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-96-and-of-w-30347065" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 96 &lt;/a &gt;about her book on Robert Oppenheimer and the rhetoric of science advisors.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2QP6Fze" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://monoskop.org/images/e/e4/Latour_Bruno_We_Have_Never_Been_Modern.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;. We restricted ourselves in this discussion to books 1 and 2 through section 3.2, plus sections 5.1 and 5.2 to get an idea of Latour's solution at the end. The book that Latour discusses so much about Robert Boyle vs. Thomas Hobbes is &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/069117816X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=069117816X &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=b604456be9a5019c95a087e8d425c5cd" target="_blank"&gt;Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1985).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Mono No Aware" by Guy Sigsworth, as discussed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem109-guy-sigsworth/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #109 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Note &lt;/strong &gt;: There will be no 2020 wall calendar for sale, but there are lots of newish tote bags and other things on &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/shopdonate/" target="_blank"&gt;our store &lt;/a &gt;for your holiday shopping enjoyment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On René Descartes's &lt;em &gt;Rules for Direction of the Mind &lt;/em &gt;(1628).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is there a careful way to approach problems that will ensure that you'll always be right? What if you're just really careful to never assert anything you can't be sure of? This is Descartes's strategy, modeled on mathematics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This early, incomplete work lays out 21 rules for careful thinking (out of a planned 36) with extensive commentary on how to apply them. It is extremely helpful in figuring out where Descartes is coming from in the &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-2-descartess-30313019" target="_blank"&gt;Meditations &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, and it lays out the foundations for both analytic philosophy and the emphasis on quantitative analysis in modern science.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The central premise is that philosophical disagreements are caused by sloppy formulation of problems. If you can break down an issue to its simplest components, then insofar as those components lie within the range of human understanding at all, everyone who carefully attends to those elements will agree about their nature. Ultimately judgment is just a matter of comparing two simple things set before the mind: We can all tell that 1 and 2 are different and that the second is greater than the first (twice as great!).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you're a scientist trying to understand something like magnetism, then, we break down what we're seeing: motion, masses, and certain types of materials (the magnet and the attracted metal). We make observations and try to quantify everything (e.g. distances between the magnet and the metal, different masses of the two) and come up with ratios and thus a formula for how changing one factor (e.g. distance) changes another (attraction) all others being equal. We thereby come up with some formulas that describe the phenomena of magnetism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But notice what this leaves out: We don't actually know what magnetism is, i.e. the nature of the forces behind it. For a 17th century experimental scientist, Descartes would say that we simply can't know anything about magnetism's intrinsic nature, and to pretend we can is just unwarranted mysticism. Now, with technology that increases the capacity of our senses to further isolate the elements involved (we can now get down to the atomic level and say exactly how various metals are chemically different from each other), we can say more about magnetism, but there are still limits to our understanding (consider our current theories of gravity).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Descartes is known as a rationalist, and as I said, his method is based on that used in mathematical reasoning, but in practice, he's closer to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-226-francis-30185810" target="_blank"&gt;Bacon &lt;/a &gt;. As we see in Descartes's later thinking in the &lt;em &gt;Meditations &lt;/em &gt;, though, he does voyage beyond "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathesis_universalis" target="_blank"&gt;Universal Mathematics &lt;/a &gt;" and realm of quantifiable scientific thought into metaphysics, because he includes among the simple, understandable elements of the universe not only things like extension and motion but also the concept of God. Why? Because we can only understand and be certain about the experienced world by abstracting from the complexity we see and viewing the basic elements in our mind's eye (our intellectual intuition) just like that viewing of 1 and 2 I described above. An empiricist will deny reality to any concept that can't be somehow reduced to something in sense experience, while a rationalist like Descartes denies that we really understand anything in experience that can't be abstracted from and analyzed by the mind. It's not the senses that deceive us precisely but our intellectual judgments about sensations. We can be absolutely certain that we are having the experiences themselves, but not about how those experiences relate to what the external world is really like.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In keeping with Descartes's directives to move slowly and carefully, Mark, Dylan, Wes, and Seth walk rule by rule through this text, making it an especially long one that we had to spread over two discussion sessions (Seth got sick and didn't show up for the last portion).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The online PDF version that we most often refer to (tr.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Kwame Anthony Appiah's "Race, Culture, Identity: Misunderstood Connections" (1994), Charles Mills's "But What Are You Really?, The Metaphysics of Race" (1998), and Neven Sesardic's "Race: A Social Destruction of a Biological Concept" (2010).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://quillette.com/author/coleman-cruz-hughes/" target="_blank"&gt;Coleman Hughes &lt;/a &gt;rejoins Mark, Seth, and Dylan to differentiate "race" as population genetics uses the term from racial identity. Mills argues that the latter has been historically constructed to track several markers that don't always go together, e.g. parentage vs. skin tone (consider siblings with different skin tones). Race in this sense is real, in that it's a socially established categorization that has real effects on how people are treated and how they see themselves. But conventions like the "one-drop rule" by which in America folks with mixed black-white ancestry are considered black are historically contingent; our racial thinking does not match the biology involved.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Appiah gives a longer, intellectual history of racialist thinking: He sees our current use of the term as faded detritus of the theories of thinkers like Matthew Arnold, Thomas Jefferson, and W.E.B. Dubois, all of whom thought of race as an essence that could be analyzed, for example in talking about how the spirit of a people informs their artworks. Appiah thinks that nothing in reality actually corresponds to such a "spirit," and that no biological categories track with our everyday concept of race, so really, races don't exist. We only need talk about them insofar as to understand the historical persecution of "witches," we would need to understand what the foolish persecutors meant by the term.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Sesardic thinks that by arguing only against this essentialist concept of race, Appiah (and many other thinkers in this area) have constructed a straw man. He thinks that philosophers talking about race need to actually look at the current science of population genetics, and that this field actually does find a genetic break-down that approximates the common racial division of Caucasian/African/Indigenous American/Asian. He rejects the common argument that because there is more within-group variation than between-group variation, therefore races aren't biologically real.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this discussion, we agree with the first two thinkers that the biological argument is rather beside the point, but since Appiah and Mills are still making arguments that involve scientific facts, even if their overall point is social and ethical, work is needed to figure out how exactly to evaluate their arguments and hence the disagreement between them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://pscourses.ucsd.edu/ps108/4%20What%20is%20race/Appiah%201996-%20Race%20Culture%20Identity.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Appiah's paper online &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://laurenralpert.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/mills-but-what-are-you-really.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Mills's paper online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2BtEhtv" target="_blank"&gt;buy the book containing it &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.ln.edu.hk/philoso/staff/sesardic/Race.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Sesardic's paper online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ian Hacking’s &lt;em &gt;The Social Construction of What &lt;/em &gt;, ch. 1 &amp;amp; 2 (1999); Peter Berger's “Religion and World Construction," i.e., the beginning of &lt;em &gt;The Sacred Canopy &lt;/em &gt;(1967), and Ron Mallon's “&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-construction-naturalistic/" target="_blank"&gt;Naturalistic Approaches to Social Construction &lt;/a &gt;” (2008, rev. 2019) from the &lt;em &gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Guest Coleman Hughes from the &lt;a href="https://thisis42.com/discover/dilemma-podcast.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dilemma &lt;/a &gt;podcast joins us to survey the ways and purposes for which people argue that various practices are socially constructed. These are roughly divided in popular discourse between the "culture wars" (e.g., race, gender) and the "science wars" (are scientific findings destined to be discovered because of the objectivity of truth or a matter of contingent social histories). In the former case, when people are given labels, these labels themselves have effects on the people involved, whereas in the latter case, the objects of natural science of course aren't aware of or affected by the labels we give them. A key lesson is that something can be both socially constructed and objective: Money is no doubt something given value only by human agreement, but when this agreement exists, the value is objectively there.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, Hacking gives us a nice breakdown of the different steps in a possible social construction argument to show how these arguments differ. First, you argue that a practice that many take for granted as natural could have been different. You might stop there, the point being just to understand why we are the way we are. Or you might go on to argue that the practice is bad for us. But still, maybe now that we have it, there's not much we can do about it, so the point might be just to bemoan our fate. A full social construction argument will say further that the practice can and should be changed. And if you say it should be changed, you may in effect deny the reality of the practice—of course it's something people believe, and so in that sense a social reality, but not referring to anything real in the world—or you might acknowledge the social construct as an objective, social fact that you'd like to change to a different social fact.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Many of the social practices at issue involve a mix of nature and nurture that is difficult if not impossible to untangle. The fact that different societies have different practices certainly gives evidence that a practice is socially constructed, but one might instead interpret these differences as one case being the natural tendency coming to fruition, while in other cases something has gone wrong. Perhaps making an argument about social construction in fact isn't really trying to state facts at all, but instead to stake out a social position. We'll explore this idea more in our next episode (also with Coleman) on the social construction of race in particular.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Berger may well have invented this term in his book, &lt;em &gt;The Social Construction of Reality &lt;/em &gt;(1966), and the chapter of his following book that we read sums up this work. He describes the nature of humanity as "incomplete," unlike animals. Animals get their whole world dictated to them by instinct, but people require socialization. He describes society as a dialectical process (i.e., back-and-forth interaction between individuals and social practices) determined in three steps: people act publicly and thus this action is externalized; these actions spread and get objectivated in customs, including group-held habits of perceiving the world and beliefs about it; and then internalization, where individuals through socialization acquire these customs. So when we think we're reporting our raw intuitions, we're really just spitting back what we've internalized.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Applying Hacking's division of types of social construction argument to Berger, I think Berger might be in the second category: We have these socially constructed practices, but it's human nature that these practices be constructed in some way or other, and these shared practices literally make up what it is to be human for us. If we deviate from them, if we throw off the veils that society has placed on us, we don't cut through to truth and reality, but instead find ourselves in a void of meaninglessness: we go crazy, lose any sense of purpose, and probably want to kill ourselves. This is, of course, existential terror, which the existentialists themselves tell us that we must learn to live with if we're honest with ourselves, but it's not clear from what we read that Berger thinks we can really take this further step. We can acknowledge that our beliefs and practices are socially conditioned but can't get rid of them (at least not very many of them; perhaps the plurality of society provides an opening for rebellious behavior through identification with other members of a minority group).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy Hacking's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674004124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674004124 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=b574c4083726f4571d11fb7f70d3d1c9" target="_blank"&gt;The Social Construction of What?&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or try &lt;a href="https://larvalsubjects.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/hacking-the-social-construction-of-what2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Sir Francis Bacon's &lt;em &gt;New Organon &lt;/em &gt;(1620), aka &lt;em &gt;Novum Organum &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;An "organon" is a toolset, and Bacon claims to have developed a new toolset that will open up nature to inquiry in a way that wasn't possible for ancient and modern natural philosophy. Mark, Wes, and Dylan consider the degree to which what Bacon describes actually corresponds to the scientific method as we would recognize it, talk through Bacon's "&lt;a href="http://www.sirbacon.org/links/4idols.htm" target="_blank"&gt;four idols &lt;/a &gt;" that interfere with impartial inquiry, and consider how Bacon's method fits in with his larger political-ethical-religious view of "instauration," whereby we gain mastery over nature, recovering from the God's curse when he kicked Man out of the garden of Eden for eating the fruit of knowledge.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Some current conflicts between science and philosophy are on display here: Bacon does believe (à la "scientism") that the scientific method applies to all subjects including human affairs, even as he does make a (merely nominal?) distinction between the realms appropriate for science and for religion. He criticizes other thinkers for jumping from a single inquiry to some kind of global theory (as when now economists see everything in terms of economics, or Freudians interpret all behavior according to that falsifiable theory). Also, Bacon's four idols may describe removable obstacles to correct use of his method, or they may well anticipate historicist/post-modern critiques of science by describing science as always performed by people with their various idiosyncratic, social, and philosophical biases. Bacon also seems to anticipate Karl Popper by stressing the value of "negative instances," where you rule out a hypothesis.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Interestingly, Bacon doesn't use the term "hypothesis" as much as one would expect. His method instead makes use of a series of tables. When investigating heat, for instance (his example that takes up the beginning of book 2), first write down all instances you can think of of heat, then related cases where heat is not present, cases where the amount of heat varies by some factor or other, then list (based on the previous tables) what you can rule out as the cause of heat, and finally you look at what's left and can give "the first vintage form" of heat, where "form" here retains a term used in the Scholastic (i.e., Aristotelian) science of his day but which in Bacon's new scheme is really getting at the law of nature behind why a thing is what it is.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We read the Joseph Devey translation (1902), which you can &lt;a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/bacon-novum-organum?q=%22Novum+Organum%22#" target="_blank"&gt;read online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1533270783/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1533270783 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=f9d19bcf8df4c1b08f4115c5a02f18a7" target="_blank"&gt;buy it &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Simone Weil's essays "The Iliad, or the Poem of Force" (1939) and "Analysis of Oppression" (1934).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How do circumstances oppress and dehumanize us? Weil describes the mechanisms that keep people at war and maintain oppression even through revolutions (the new boss tends to be as bad as the old boss) as inherent to the logic of power.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;She uses Homer's &lt;em &gt;Iliad &lt;/em &gt;to illustrate this picture of war: Force, the real hero of the epic, dehumanizes both its victims and perpetrators. When an aggressor has someone helpless and on their knees, the latter becomes no longer a human whose needs need to be recognized but an object that can be destroyed on a whim. One might think that this would be the time for magnanimity, but that would require recognition, and this is typically no longer available for an aggressor whose humanity is also being sapped by the situation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;At many points in the &lt;em &gt;Iliad &lt;/em &gt;, one or the other side is at an advantage and could with some mild concessions stop the war, but the power makes the current victors feel invulnerable, and they feel they've already sacrificed too much to settle for anything less than total destruction of the enemy. Having your fellows die brings out a nihilistic attitude in the survivors, a drive towards death for all concerned that precludes both self-preservation and mercy. And so the war grinds on.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In "Analysis of Oppression," a similar vicious circle is at play in the logic of economic domination. Weil revises &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/06/07/episode-3-hobbess-leviathan-the-social-contract/" target="_blank"&gt;Hobbes's &lt;/a &gt;picture of the state of nature: We are in nature oppressed by the forces of necessity, of having to keep from starving, but when society forms, we could theoretically be freed from this burden, but it instead shifts from oppression directly by nature to oppression by other people, which is really just nature asserting itself indirectly. Cooperative production essentially requires that some small group be the ones who understand the social structure and its tools and hence are able to issue the commands. Weil admires &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/01/30/ep70-marx-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Karl Marx &lt;/a &gt;for identifying that it's the structure of capitalism that is responsible for the oppression, not the individual capitalists, but thinks that Marxists are foolish to think that a revolution can fix this. In Russia, for instance, it's not the case that the weaker (the workers) overcame the stronger (the Czarist government), but that the already-weak Czarists were displaced by industrial forces that already had de facto power. The weak by definition can't overcome the strong; power dynamics are created by material conditions, and apparent revolutions are just going to be shifts from one declining power center to an ascending one.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Guest Corey Mohler, writer of &lt;a href="https://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Existential Comics &lt;/a &gt;, rejoins Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth (check out &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/05/14/ep164-dostoyevsky-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;his previous appearance &lt;/a &gt;) to tackle this fascinating figure who was a major influence on &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/06/22/episode-4-camus-and-the-absurd/" target="_blank"&gt;Albert Camus &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Soren Kierkegaard's essay "The Present Age" (1846) and Hubert Dreyfus’s "Nihilism on the Information Highway: Anonymity vs. Commitment in the Present Age" (2004).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's wrong with our society? Kierkegaard saw the advent of the press and gossip culture as engendering a systematic passivity and shallowness in his fellows, and Dreyfus thinks this is an even more apt description of the Internet Age, where it's easy to spout anonymous, not-well-thought-out opinions without risk or commitment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Guest &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@johnganz" target="_blank"&gt;John Ganz &lt;/a &gt;joins Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan to explore and evaluate Kierkegaard's claims. Is it correct to describe this age as "too reflective" as opposed to revolutionary ages when people actually got out of the house and did things, with their full commitment? Were things really better when people were less prudent, more prone to making "a big stupid blunder?" Is his dismissal of "chatter" as opposed to the inwardness of silence, really just another case of sexist Stoicism? Does it make sense for Kierkegaard himself, with his concern for his public reputation, his lack of commitment (especially in his love life), his hyper-reflectivity, and his logorrheic preachiness to be making this critique? Finally, does this critique really apply so well to the Internet, or just to particularly toxic parts of it?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"The Present Age" is actually the conclusion of &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691140766/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691140766 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=b98ac9eb2f9e0d7d33a48520a53a857b" target="_blank"&gt;Two Ages: The Age of Revolution and the Present Age A Literary Review &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/present_age_i.html" target="_blank"&gt;Here's an excerpt online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;For the climax and denouement of our summer philosophy of mind series, Ned Block himself comes on to help us fill in the gaps about functionalism and attributing consciousness to machines. We discuss two essays by other authors responding to Ned's work from the collection &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N39L5X2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07N39L5X2 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=85a01d58449f0249eb960901d7d457bc" target="_blank"&gt;Blockheads!: Essays on Ned Block's Philosophy of Mind and Consciousness &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2019), ed. Adam Pautz and Daniel Stoljar.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In our first half, we clarify Ned's typology of consciousness, distinguishing &lt;a href="https://protoscience.fandom.com/wiki/Phenomenal_and_Access_Conciousness" target="_blank"&gt;phenomenal consciousness from access consciousness &lt;/a &gt;and continue the discussion we began in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-219-harder-of-28036316" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 219 &lt;/a &gt;, covering &lt;a href="https://philosophy.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/details/182-faculty1/faculty-profiles/621-brianmclaughlin" target="_blank"&gt;Brian McLaughlin’s &lt;/a &gt;“Could an Android be Sentient?” and Ned's &lt;em &gt;Blockheads!&lt;/em &gt;response, "Functional Role, Superficialism, and Commander Data: Reply to Brian McLaughlin." While McLaughlin believes that our biological dissimilarity from robots is sufficient justification for our not attributing phenomenal consciousness to them, Ned now thinks that if a robot were a functional duplicate of a person, that would be a strong (though defeasible) reason to attribute such consciousness, especially if the isomorphism ran very deep (we also go into what "deep" might mean here).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second half of our interview, we consider another &lt;em &gt;Blockheads!&lt;/em &gt;essay, &lt;a href="https://www.michaeltye.us/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Tye’s &lt;/a &gt;“Homunculi Heads and Silicon Chips: The Importance of History to Phenomenology" along with Ned's "Fading Qualia: A Response to Michael Tye." This continues directly from our discussion in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-222-debating-28766145" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 222 &lt;/a &gt;of David Chalmers's fading qualia argument. Tye, like Chalmers, thinks that gradually replacing bits of a conscious brain with mechanical bits wouldn't change the character of experience that the person with that brain is having. Tye wants to distinguish between this case and cases like Block's "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_brain" target="_blank"&gt;China brain &lt;/a &gt;" that don't have consciousness experience by pointing to history: The gradually replaced organism has a continual history as it changes, and so maintains consciousness, while a brain-functional-simulation by the a population has no historical connection to an uncontroversially conscious being. Ned does not find this convincing at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the last half hour of this episode, Mark, Seth, Dylan, and Wes continue discussing some of these issues after Ned's departure, immediately showing that we are still confused and considering possible future avenues that we might investigate whenever we next circle back to philosophy of mind... which will likely not be very soon, but who knows?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Watch Ned talk about his current work on the border between perception and cognition &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wKAQeYHOmlEg" target="_blank"&gt;on YouTube.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Your So Dark Sleep/Goodbye" by The Black Watch.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ned Block's “&lt;a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/1978.troubles.with.f.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Troubles with Functionalism &lt;/a &gt;” (1978) and David Chalmers’s “&lt;a href="http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html" target="_blank"&gt;Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia &lt;/a &gt;” (1995).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If mental states are functional states, there couldn't be zombies, i.e., something functionally equivalent to you but which yet doesn't have qualia (a sense of "what it's like" to be you… an inner life). Yet Block claims that there could be such zombies: for example, a functional duplicate of you whose components &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_brain" target="_blank"&gt;are actually all the citizens of China &lt;/a &gt;acting according to signals broadcasted by satellites according to algorithmic rules. Even if the resulting system acts like you, it obviously isn't conscious.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Chalmers argues that if you buy this story about functional zombies being physically possible, you'd then need to explain the experiences of a creature half way between you and the zombie (like if you replaced your neurons with little circuits one by one, each of which exactly duplicated the function of that neuron), but you can't: If you have an experience of being red, and the zombie (even though it claims to have such an experience) doesn't, would the half-you/half-zombie have half an experience? A pale pink experience? A washed-out grey experience? A dimming experience? Or is there some point at which the lights suddenly go off, so the halfway point would be equivalent to either the before or after depending on where that point is? Chalmers thinks that none of the possible descriptions makes sense, so Block's argument doesn't work and functionalism is left standing. What do you think?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Do you hate weird thought experiments like these like Seth does? Do you think like Wes that Block and Chalmers are really talking past each other, that Block is only attacking reductive functionalism, and Chalmers's argument only succeeds in defending nonreductive functionalism (i.e., function and mentality are correlated, or more specifically supervenient, but not actually one and the same)? Do you think like Mark that this is a totally separate issue than the hard problem (which Block and Chalmers both agree is a real problem that functionalism doesn't solve), and so the other guys should stop dragging the conversation back to that every single episode? Or are you like Dylan who didn't show up to this episode?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Machine" by Helen Money as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem101-helen-money/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #101 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Hilary Putnam’s "&lt;a href="http://web.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/putnam.nature.mental.states.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Nature of Mental States &lt;/a &gt;" (1973) and David M. Armstrong’s "&lt;a href="https://people.stfx.ca/cbyrne/Byrne/Armstrong%20-%20Causal%20Theory%20of%20the%20Mind.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Causal Theory of the Mind &lt;/a &gt;" (1981).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the mind? Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth consider a theory of mind that defines things not by what they're made of, but what they do. What does this mean? Well, what makes something a mousetrap, for instance, is that it catches mice. It could be made of wood, or metal, or something else, but the point is that it has a structure that will achieve this task. A functionalist theory of mental states, then, defines mental states not as essentially brain states, but as the organism performing some special class of tasks: being in pain, experiencing a memory, having a sensation of color, etc.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A common analogy for this is that the brain is like the hardware that the mind runs on, and the mind is like the software code. Groups of neurons fire off in lawlike ways, transmitting information around the brain, and it's that information pattern that is the mind. Hilary Putnam developed this idea, as presented seminally by &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/06/10/reissue-ep-21-mind-turing/" target="_blank"&gt;Alan Turing &lt;/a &gt;, into "machine-table functionalism," where we get an idea of what a particular mental state is by creating a sort of a flowchart: If the machine is in a particular state (defined by the current values of numerous components) and receives a particular input, then it will (probably) move to a particular other state. Check out &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)#Machine-state_functionalism" target="_blank"&gt;this wiki page &lt;/a &gt;for a simple example of this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why be a functionalist? Well, as discussed in our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/07/01/ep219-block-papineau/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 219 &lt;/a &gt;, mind-brain identity theory seems too chauvinistic: If we say that what constitutes a pain is a particular type of brain state, then any type of creature that doesn't have a brain like ours by definition can't be in pain. If we define pain instead as some kind of typical behavior, like the disposition to writhe around, then that could apply to any number of creatures. But of course that sort of behaviorism is not really accurate: I could very well be in pain and not writhe around, maybe because I've conditioned myself to not show my pain, and/or because I'm exercising or receiving a needed medical treatment or am a masochist and so am tolerating or even actually want the pain. Functionalism advances on behaviorism by allowing mental states to be defined not just in terms of behavior (inputs and outputs) but in terms of other mental states. The belief "it is raining" is identified not just by my disposition to carry an umbrella, because clearly there are lots of other beliefs and desires that could affect whether this behavior manifests.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;David M. Armstrong's article specifically defines the need for functionalism in terms of making materialism make sense. How can a mental state &lt;em &gt;be &lt;/em &gt;a brain state, when those seem like such different kinds of stuff? Well, if the mental is defined as actions which the brain does, or more precisely dispositions to action which the brain has, that provides a nice model for us to understand why these things seem so different; the mental is not "stuff" at all, but activity. This solution actually goes back to Aristotle in the &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/01/11/ep131-1aristotle-mind/" target="_blank"&gt;De Anima &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, who defined the soul as the "form" of the body.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Functionalism is really a class of views, not a single view. Armstrong's view is analytic aka a priori functionalism, which says that what we really mean in ordinary language by mental terms is something functional. Putnam's machine-table functionalism is a type of empirical functionalism aka psychofunctionalism (at least according to Ned Block's account of these distinctions), which says that no, the functional schematic doesn't have to be connected to what our ordinary language mental terms mean, but is instead supposed to elaborate the best psychological theories we have. This division is comparable to the one Chalmers made (see ep. 218) between Type A materialists (who claim that materialism is true a priori, implied in the definitions of mental terms themselves) and Type B materialists (who claim that it's instead a scientific discovery that mind = brain). So even though functionalism is a step away from mind-brain identity theory (in fact, Chalmers himself is a functionalist, even though he's not a materialist at all), similar questions come up in defining why or how you're a functionalist to why or how you're a materialist. Are we saying that functionalism (or mind-brain identity) captures our intuitions (at least after we've thought about them carefully), or is this a scientific issue, such that it doesn't actually matter whether the theory in question is counter-intuitive?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does functionalism solve the "hard problem of consciousness" as Chalmers defined it in our ep. 218? Both Putnam and Armstrong describe functional states as exhausting what it is to be in a mental state: to be in pain, for instance, is to possess a particular functional organization. Putnam articulates the distinction we discussed with regard to &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/07/01/ep219-block-papineau/" target="_blank"&gt;Papineau &lt;/a &gt;between concepts and properties: mental concepts (including presumably qualia, though Putnam doesn't use this term) and physical concepts refer to the same underlying property, just like water and H20 do. This is essentially just Frege's sense-reference distinction.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Armstrong tries to interpret mental states in terms of their causes or "intentions," i.e. what in the world they are aiming at. This translates into direct realism (see our &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/04/25/ep138-1-john-searle/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 138 with Searle &lt;/a &gt;, and yes, we know &lt;a href="http://dailynous.com/2019/06/21/searle-found-violated-sexual-harassment-policies/" target="_blank"&gt;Searle is gross &lt;/a &gt;) with regard to perception. It's not that we perceive a mental entity, a quale, and then have to make sense of this weird sort of entity, but that perception just connects us via causality with the world: "what it is like" to see a horse is just the horse that caused our perception of it. Armstrong recognizes that this raises "the problem of the secondary qualities," given that colors, smells, sounds, etc. are not strictly speaking in the world in the way that a horse is. Armstrong also considers emotions, and concludes following William James that these are experiences of our own physiology. Armstrong considers that experiencing a color may be a matter of a systematic illusion: The sensation is caused by a certain wavelength of light, but it's impossible for us to perceive it that way. We perceive a simple quality, possessed by the surface we're looking at, but the object is in fact complex. Armstrong doesn't see this discrepancy as threatening materialism, though of course Chalmers (and Block) will disagree about this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A complicated recurring issue is whether "pain" and other mental terms pick out the same thing in all possible worlds (this is how we can think about what the word means and what's essential about it metaphysically). If this interests you at all, you should just go back and re-listen to our previous episodes on &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/11/02/ep126-1-kripke/" target="_blank"&gt;Kripke &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/11/30/ep128-1-putnam/" target="_blank"&gt;Putnam &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For more introductory information, take a look at the articles on functionalism in the &lt;a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/functism/" target="_blank"&gt;Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy &lt;/a &gt;and the &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy &lt;/a &gt;. We took as one of our introductory sources the in-depth introduction by Ned Block in an article we'll be discussing for ep. 222: "&lt;a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/1978.troubles.with.f.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Troubles with Functionalism &lt;/a &gt;" (1978). Both the Putnam and Armstrong articles, along with an abridged version of this Block article, can be found in David Chalmers-edited compendium, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019514581X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=019514581X &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a914ec5245b46229fa29fb448d1ff0e2" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2002).

Why don't colleges pay their faculty to educate the public through regular, broadcasted conversations like ours? If you think we're snarky, take a look at actual philosophy faculty! Should we continue to do more literature, poetry, and other topics that are not strictly philosophy?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What counts as binge watching? Why do we do it? Is it bad for us?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yes, this is a new podcast for the PEL Network. It'll launch formally on July 15, but you can also already listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/pretty-much-pop-27578233" target="_blank"&gt;episode 1 &lt;/a &gt;, and if you go pledge a little support on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/prettymuchpop" target="_blank"&gt;patreon.com/prettymuchpop &lt;/a &gt;, you can also hear episode 3 with comedian &lt;a href="https://yakov.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Yakov Smirnoff &lt;/a &gt;as well as more bonus discussion related to this here episode and several communications about the present and future of this new endeavor. Signing up there will ensure that your episodes will always be without advertisements, and will guarantee that for the first several episodes at least, you'll get to hear them well in advance of the general public.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this discussion, Mark Linsenmayer, Erica Spyres, and Brian Hirt reveal their watching habits (growing up and now) and marvel at crazy-high &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/u-s-adults-now-spend-nearly-6-hours-per-day-watching-video" target="_blank"&gt;stats &lt;/a &gt;about how much people watch.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ned Block's "&lt;a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/HarderProblem.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Harder Problem of Consciousness &lt;/a &gt;" (2002) and David Papineau's "&lt;a href="https://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/885/1/D_Papineau_Science..pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Could There Be a Science of Consciousness?&lt;/a &gt;" (2003).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What would give us sufficient reason to believe that a non-human was conscious? Block thinks this is a harder problem that we might suspect. We can't know for sure exactly what consciousness in us is, so we can't know for sure what such a being might require (a brain? certain patterns of behavior?) for them to be enough like us that we could safely apply our own experience of our own conscious states to them. Papineau diagnoses this as a fundamental vagueness in the concepts we use to describe our conscious states.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This conversation continues from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/06/15/ep218-chalmers-consciousness-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 218 &lt;/a &gt;, with guest &lt;a href="https://gregmillerphilosophy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gregory Miller &lt;/a &gt;from the Panpsycast Philosophy Podcast rejoining Mark, Wes, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As you'll recall, the "hard" problem (per Chalmers) is us not being able to understand how first-person experience (qualia) results from brain matter. To complicate this, the same issue comes up if we assume that what is essential to a mental state is not a precise kind of brain state (which would rule out automatically robots and aliens and the like also being in this state), but instead a "functional organization." Ep. 220 and 221 will be all about functionalism, but briefly, it's the idea that what makes a pain a pain is that it has certainly typical causes (getting hurt) and certain typical effects (pain expression behaviors), so creatures with different kinds of brain materials could nonetheless feel pain. But of course, since functional organization is not referring to private mental experiences, it still seems possible (just as for materialism) that there could be a creature that has the relevant functional organization (or for materialism, matter) and yet not have the pain qualia, the actual experience of pain.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Functionalism is picking up on the idea from Alan Turing that if, say, Data from &lt;em &gt;Star Trek &lt;/em &gt;or C-3PO from &lt;em &gt;Star Wars &lt;/em &gt;can hold a convincing conversation with us, then heck, why would we not call that robot conscious? I mean, that's how we judge whether other people are conscious, right? Block claims that when we judge another person to be conscious, we're not just relying on their convincing behavior, but also because we know that they're the same types of creatures we are. We can't be strictly CERTAIN that any other human has qualia (the philosophical problem of other minds), but we sure do have strong rational grounds for believing this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The same will go for, e.g., a judgment that an animal is in pain. We understand what pain behavior looks like, and we understand that other mammals at least have similar nervous systems to ours, so it's entirely reasonable for us to believe that animals feel pain and have other qualia, even though their brains are unlike ours in certain ways.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But for a robot (or alien, or even an octopus whose brains have developed via a very different evolutionary track than ours), we have no such assurance that the light of consciousness is really on even if there's a very accurate simulation of human conversation. We might want to follow Turing in classifying the system as "intelligent" or "thinking," but whether it is conscious is simply inaccessible to us. Moreover, Block classifies it as "meta-inaccessible," because we not only don't know whether Data is conscious, but we also have no idea what would even count as rational grounds for belief that he's conscious. This is what Block calls the Harder Problem, which is like the Hard Problem but adds this Other Minds problem wrinkle, adding an extra layer of confusion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;David Papineau's paper was recommended to us as a simpler way of presenting essentially the same issue. In our own case, we know we have qualia, we know that when, say, a pain quale is going on that there's some particular brain state involved (we might not now know which, but brain scientists can figure it out), and this "pain" also has a particular functional organization which one can try to chart out the nuances of and maybe use that to inform a computer simulation of pain. (If it seems weird to think about pain in this respect, think instead about what it is to have a belief or memory or desire; these are all typically related to each other causally, i.e. if I have a desire for an apple, a belief that there's an apple in front of me, and other related beliefs and desires that I can have the apple, that I don't know from experience that apples make me sick, etc., then I typically grab for the apple.) But we don't know which (the brain state or the functional organization) the quale is actually identical to (assuming it's identical to one of these, i.e. that materialism is true, which Papineau like Block has independent reasons for assuming). Following Wittgenstein, Papineau thinks that words only make sense in the context in which they're originally used; they're just too vague to be applied to the crazy cases philosophers think of. For Papineau, it's just indeterminate whether the pain-like behavior that Data might be exhibiting really counts as "pain." Maybe there's no single cross-species concept of pain at all, and we'd just have to figure out for practical purposes, e.g. whether to accept their protestations of pain (and so stop hurting them) or not. Block thinks this result is intolerable: either Data is in pain (and has other qualia) or he's not (doesn't).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Papineau's longer treatment of the hard and harder problems is &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E9GUHC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002E9GUHC &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=639da1704521447065059f0363e2dcd8" target="_blank"&gt;Thinking about Consciousness &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2002).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Mindreader" by Phil Judd from &lt;a href="https://philjudd.bandcamp.com/album/play-it-strange-2014-solo-album" target="_blank"&gt;Play It Strange &lt;/a &gt;(2014).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "Consciousness and Its Place in Nature" by David Chalmers (2003), with special guest &lt;a href="https://gregmillerphilosophy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gregory Miller &lt;/a &gt;from &lt;a href="https://thepanpsycast.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Panpsycast Philosophy Podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Can we explain human experience using the terms of brain physiology? Well, it depends what you mean by "explain." Our experience has a qualitative character: the feeling of red, the smell of methane, the feel of a cat's scratchy tongue. We can do research and figure out what parts of the body gather this sensory data, how they get to the brain, and which parts of the brain activate when we have these experiences, but according to Chalmers, that still doesn't actually explain why a particular brain state should have the feel to us that it does. We still don't understand how a physical event can cause a mental phenomenon, much less how (or whether) a mental event like an "intention" then causes our physical movements. Physical accounts employ a vocabulary of structure and function, these "feels" (the technical term is "qualia") don't seem amenable to that kind of explanation, therefore there's a conceptual gap between science and the consciousness, and bridging this is what Chalmers famously refers to as "the hard problem of consciousness." For more motivation about why this might be a problem, see our discussion of Thomas Negel's "What Is It Like to Be a Bat" in our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/reissue-ep-21-is-27527092"&gt;ep. 21 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"Consciousness and Its Place in Nature" first goes through the different forms of the argument for such a gap, then gives a typology of the kinds of solution that have been proposed, arguing as he goes that the materialist solutions are unsatisfactory in various ways but that other solutions hold more promise. Where appropriate in the discussion, we bring up the two papers that we'll be focusing on for ep. 219 (they were actually planned for this one, but the Chalmers paper was so rich that we just ended up taking all of our time on it): Ned Block's "&lt;a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/HarderProblem.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Harder Problem of Consciousness &lt;/a &gt;" (2002) and David Papineau's "&lt;a href="https://www.newdualism.org/papers/D.Papineau/Papineau-sci_of_cnscsnss-phil_issues-fin_rev.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Could There Be a Science of Consciousness?&lt;/a &gt;" (2003).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The three arguments he gives against materialism are:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;The explanatory argument &lt;/strong &gt;. This is the one I just gave: explaining structure and function does not suffice to explain consciousness. Some prominent philosophers like Daniel Dennett deny this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;The conceivably argument &lt;/strong &gt;. This is the one that brings up "zombies." It's probably not physically possible that some creature identical in behavior to you could nonetheless not have any of your qualia, but conceptually, it is possible, and maybe such creatures could have existed in a very different sort of universe (it's metaphysically possible).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;The knowledge argument &lt;/strong &gt;. This is the one that comes out of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument" target="_blank"&gt;Frank Jackson's papers about Mary the color scientist &lt;/a &gt;who has lived her whole life in a room without color but nonetheless has read every book about what color vision is, how it works in the brain, etc. (Imagine that these books contain even the physiological details that current scientists don't know.) When she emerges from the room and sees color for the first time first-hand, this argument claims that she learns a new fact over and above all the physical facts that were contained in the books. There therefore must be "phenomenal facts" that are distinct from all those physical facts that she knew."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;Chalmers then goes through the various positions about consciousness in philosophy of mind literature with an eye to how they respond to these arguments:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Type A Materialism &lt;/strong &gt;is materialism like Gilbert Ryle's (see our ep. #21) or Pat Churchland's (see our ep. 41) that just insist that consciousness can be fully explained by considerations of function and structure, that zombies as described above aren't legitimately conceivable, and that Mary emerging from the room does not learn any new facts, because there aren't any new facts to learn.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To understand this, it might help to think about Wittgenstein's private language argument: No word in our (or any) language can refer to something that only a single individual can identify. The relation between sign and signified, to be meaningful, needs to stay relatively fixed, and if it's just a word you made up to stand for some private thing in your head, there'd be no way to ensure that its meaning wouldn't drift all over the place. Yet we talk about "pain" and "red" and other seemingly phenomenal experiences all the time. Well, says the argument, then we must be referring to pain-behavior: we see people writhing around in pain and so identify pain, and really, we only secondarily figure out that this sharp sensation now is also pain, largely because our parents, etc., treat us as if we are in pain. So "pain" doesn't refer to a phenomenal quality at all. There really are no words for such qualities, and so they can play no role in our theories: Saying someone did something from an "intention" and some "beliefs" is to make a functional model of their mind (more on this in ep. 220) to try to explain their behavior. We don't learn about intentions and beliefs by introspecting, pointing inwardly, and saying, "Look, an intention! A belief!"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dan Dennett goes so far as to deny (in "&lt;a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/quinqual.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Quining Qualia &lt;/a &gt;," discussed briefly in ep. 21) that there are such things as qualia. Certainly there can't be "facts" about these qualia. Chalmers thinks this point of view is very strange and denies the obvious. Whether or not our experience of ourselves is actually informative, i.e.,, whether we can know by contemplating our qualia of red what that qualia actually is in some intrinsic sense, whether or not we can therefore put it into words and say anything really informative about it, much less use the term in an explanation of something else, clearly we do have these experiences, and they are the thing to be explained.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;Type B Materialism &lt;/strong &gt;is the more common scientific type of materialism that doesn't claim that there's anything conceptually wrong with claiming that there could be zombies or phenomenal facts, but claims that as a matter of scientific fact, a phenomenal state is equal to a brain state. It's not just that they're correlated events, but that one simply IS the other, and that this is something we've discovered through science, much like we discovered that water is H2O. So the difference between Type A and Type B is that for Type A, the identity is &lt;em &gt;a priori &lt;/em &gt;(a matter of the concepts involved) whereas for Type B, the identity is empirical (something science discovered, not just a matter of concepts).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;An argument relevant to this position that we've considered is from &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/11/02/ep126-1-kripke/" target="_blank"&gt;Saul Kripke &lt;/a &gt;(alluded to in ep. 126), who argues that even though "water" and "H2O" don't mean the same thing, once science discovers that they are identical, we know that they're metaphysically identical. If we consider an alternate possible world where the stuff that serves the function of water (runs in rivers and streams, is for drinking, looks and tastes like water) had a different chemical composition, Kripke argues that actually, that stuff they have still wouldn't be what we call water. He's appealing to our linguistic intuitions to prove this. "Water" is essentially defined by its chemical structure, not its function. However, imagine a comparable case with pain: Let's say we've discovered that pain in us is always accompanied by brain state &lt;em &gt;P &lt;/em &gt;. In an alternate world, there are creatures who also phenomenally feel pain, but they have different types of brains, and so they're in brain state &lt;em &gt;Q &lt;/em &gt;. Would they (according to our language) actually be feeling pain? Yes, according to Kripke. Unlike water, "pain" is defined according to its phenomenal character, not its underlying material composition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Type B materialists might like Kripke's analysis of water, but would argue that his analysis of pain is wrong: that pain is exactly like water in this respect. People in the other world with brain state Q might be feeling something functionally similar to pain, and we might have practical reasons if we meet these people to treat their "Q-state pain" as the social equivalent of our "P-state pain," but assuming science really has discovered that P is the thing that pain matches up with in us, then we're going to have to say that, like water, what pain &lt;em &gt;really &lt;/em &gt;is is its underlying structure.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The other positions Chalmers covers are interactionism (aka Type D Dualism, from Descartes), where mind and body are separate substances that somehow mysteriously interact; epiphenomenalism (Type E Dualism), where mind is a mere byproduct of brain action, so brain states cause mental states, but it's just an illusion that mental states in turn cause physical changes (the neuroscientific data used to support this that Mark refers to is &lt;a href="http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html" target="_blank"&gt;the Libet Experiment &lt;/a &gt;); and "Type F Monism" which posits that there's just a single substance that's beyond what (Newtonian) physics currently understands the world to be. This includes pansychism, the idea that all matter is in some sense conscious or proto-conscious. The panschist answers the hard problem by saying that it's not the burden of the brain to explain why this fundamentally different seeming stuff (qualia) arises out of its particular structure, because qualia are in some sense everywhere. This is a very weird view, but it's one of Greg's specialties, so we let him fill us in on some of the possible details of this view near the end of our discussion. One of the papers he referred to is Pat Lewtas's "&lt;a href="http://consc.net/event/reef/lewtasquark.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;What Is It Like to Be a Quark?&lt;/a &gt;"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://consc.net/papers/nature.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Chalmers's paper online &lt;/a &gt;, or go ahead and pick up the wonderful collection that David edited, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019514581X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=019514581X &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a914ec5245b46229fa29fb448d1ff0e2" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which we'll be drawing on for a few of the next episodes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Georgia Hard" by Robbie Fulks, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem-36-robbie-fulks-ambassador-of-country/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #36 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is pop culture? Does it make sense to distinguish it from high culture, or can something be both?  &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Yes, Mark has started yet another podcast, this time with recent PEL guest Erica Spyres and Constellary Tales host Brian Hirt. (This discussion also features our editor Tyler Hislop.) &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We'll be talking about TV, movies, music, comedy, comics, games, theater, and much more. But this first discussion is pretty meta, i.e. we're still doing philosophy, and we're in effect continuing the conversation from the PEL &lt;em &gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em &gt;episode where Wes was distinguishing high culture like Shakespeare from junk food TV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get in on the ground floor of that podcast, and hear some immediate bonus audio (we'll be posting a lot more of that per episode for PMP than for PEL), please consider joining us at &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/prettymuchpop"&gt;patreon.com/prettymuchpop &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some links relevant to this episode:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"&lt;a href="https://psmag.com/.amp/social-justice/william-shakespeare-culture-war-highbrow-lowbrow-94733" target="_blank"&gt;The Long War Between Highbrow and Lowbrow &lt;/a &gt;" by Noah Berlatsky from the &lt;em &gt;Pacific Standard &lt;/em &gt;(2017)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/pop-culture-tragedy-american-dream/amp/" target="_blank"&gt;Pop Culture's Progress Toward Tragedy &lt;/a &gt;" by Titus Techera from the &lt;em &gt;National Review &lt;/em &gt;(2019)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You may also enjoy &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/04/11/ep37-1-bourdieu/" target="_blank"&gt;episode 137 of The Partially Examined Life &lt;/a &gt;about the tastes of social classes that analyzes Pierre Bourdieu.

Featuring Mark Linsenmayer, Alan Cook, Evan Gould, Russ Baker, Steve Lindsay, and Marilyn Lawrence. Recorded 11/17/12.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He argues for a form of property dualism in which consciousness, or more likely something like "proto-consciousness" is best conceived as a fundamental feature of the world, i.e. that whenever you have physical representation of information, then you have correlated with that what you might call a point of view from the standpoint of that information. He actually has a section entitled "What Is It Like to Be a Thermostat?" where he argues that some form of panpscyhism is at least not obviously absurd, and that the problems it introduces might be preferable to those raised by views that simply equate mind and body, or say that mind is reducible to body.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing articles by Alan Turing, Gilbert Ryle, Thomas Nagel, John Searle, and Dan Dennett.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plus a new intro by Mark, Wes, and Seth reflecting back on this 2010 discussion, which we're re-releasing to help you prepare for our upcoming episodes in this area.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is this mind stuff, and how can it "be" the brain? Can computers think? No? What if they're really sexified? Then can they think? Can the mind be a computer? Can it be a room with a guy in it that doesn't speak Chinese? Can science completely understand it? ...The mind, that is, not the room, or Chinese. What is it like to be a bat? What about a weevil? Do you even know what a weevil is, really? Then how do you know it's not a mind? Hmmmm? Is guest podcaster Marco Wise a robot? Even his wife cannot be sure!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We introduce the mind/body problem and the wackiness that it engenders by breezing through several articles, which you may read along with us:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;1. Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “&lt;a href="http://loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html" target="_blank"&gt;Computing Machinery and Intelligence.&lt;/a &gt;"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;2. A chapter of Gilbert Ryle's 1949 book &lt;em &gt;The Concept of Mind &lt;/em &gt;called "&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/8911778/Gilbert-Ryle-Descartes-Myth" target="_blank"&gt;Descartes' Myth.&lt;/a &gt;"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;3. Thomas Nagel's 1974 essay "&lt;a href="http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/nagel_nice.html" target="_blank"&gt;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&lt;/a &gt;"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;4. John Searle's Chinese Room argument, discussed in a 1980 piece, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071210043312/http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html" target="_blank"&gt;"Minds, Brains and Programs."&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;5.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the 1636 comedy by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, considering destiny (Christian vs. Ancient Greek), skepticism, meta-theater, and the ethic of honor.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We used &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486424731/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0486424731 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=f80f64a86c8ce35e53a855b06b50e750" target="_blank"&gt;Stanley Appelbaum's 2002 translation with his introduction &lt;/a &gt;. Some optional articles we refer to are Sophie Kluge's &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/10047009/Calder%C3%B3ns_Anti-Tragic_Theater_The_Resonance_of_Plato_s_Critique_of_Tragedy_in_La_Vida_Es_Sue%C3%B1o_" target="_blank"&gt;"Calderón's Anti-Tragic Theater: The Resonance of Plato's Critique of Tragedy in 'La vida es sueño'"&lt;/a &gt;(2008), Thomas Austin O'Connor's &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270308073_Is_the_Spanish_Comedia_a_Metatheater" target="_blank"&gt;"Is the Spanish Comedia a Metatheater?"&lt;/a &gt;(1975), and Leonie Pawlita's &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/37917804/Dream_And_Doubt_Skepticism_In_Shakespeare_s_Hamlet_And_Calder%C3%B3n_s_La_Vida_Es_Sue%C3%B1o" target="_blank"&gt;"Dream and Doubt: Skepticism in Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Calderón’s La vida es sueño"&lt;/a &gt;(2018).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan are joined by actors Bill Youmans and Erica Spyres to talk through the issues the play raises. We consider the whole notion that "life is a dream" as skepticism. &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/05/13/episode-2-descartess-meditations-what-can-we-know/" target="_blank"&gt;Descartes's famous &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/05/13/episode-2-descartess-meditations-what-can-we-know/" target="_blank"&gt;Meditations &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;were published in 1641, only five years after this. But Descartes just uses skepticism as a methodological step and ultimately rejects it. Montaigne, however, around 1580 had already expressed a skepticism closer to Calderón's: Human reason is conceited and fallible, and will never ground true knowledge, so there's no sense in taking our speculations about the ultimate state of the world too seriously. And there's no threat in this attitude to falling into existential despair if we just fall back on common sense, on what we all (i.e., they all in this historical period) really know about our place in the world, i.e., we should just have faith in God and traditional religion. To borrow a quote from &lt;em &gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em &gt;(which we do bring up for comparison a bit here), "it is known."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is a very practical point of view, centered on ethics, and within that realm Calderón isn't just spouting dogma, but is critical of our (their) not-entirely-consistent storehouse of ethical doctrines. Much of the play is a meditation on honor, with Rosaura wanting to kill Astolfo for violating her honor, and Calderón both respects this moral consideration yet ultimately does not give it reign, and in fact makes fun of honor's seeming conundrums (e.g., if I do you a favor, I put you in my debt, and thereby hurt you whenever I help you).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Still, considerations that determine right and honorable action are for the most part pretty evident when you think about them, according to Calderón. King Basilio, as a father, had the duty to raise his son with diligence and care, but he was foolish and let his pretensions to scientific knowledge override his common sense: He delved into astrology ("subtle mathematics") and thought he had reason to fear his son, and so locked him in a tower to be raised, thereby actually fulfilling the prophecy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Segismundo the son was on the one hand raised with Christian doctrine (by his jailer Clotaldo) but on the other hand considers himself educated by nature itself, chained up in the wilderness with only animals and the sky for company much of the time. When he is informed of his true heritage and put in a position of power, he immediately abuses it. Yet he's very soon transformed: When he's locked back up and told that it was just a dream, he sees that 1) Power is just an illusion, that disperses as soon as those you have power over stop playing along, 2) Any ambition is really illusion, because it can be taken away from you and doesn't provide the satisfaction it promises even when you achieve it, and 3) Acting virtuously is good for the actor, and is something you actually do have control over, so you should act that way even and especially if life is a dream.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When soldiers come in Act III to free Segismundo, he doesn't just say, "Oh, I guess I was lied to when I was told that Act II was a dream"; instead, in keeping with the above, he thinks that even now, as he's being freed and potentially elevated back into power, that is in a strong sense a dream. This whole attitude very much accords with the Platonic notion that worldly things like power and even physical harm aren't really real, because they involve change. It's only the divine world that's real, and virtue is a turning inward toward that eternal realm. You can see the play as a variation of Plato's allegory of the cave in &lt;em &gt;The Republic &lt;/em &gt;: Segismundo starts in a literal cave, surrounded perhaps not by illusions but certainly missing out on a lot of the real things in the world, is released from the cave to see those real things in Act II but to a situation in which his ultimate situation is still illusory, and only on returning to the cave understands truth (is reminded of it by Clotaldo, really, who tells Segismundo that he should be virtuous even in dreams) so that he then can then become the Platonic philosopher-king that his father failed to be.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This whole father-fate scenario should remind us of Sophocles's &lt;em &gt;Oedipus &lt;/em &gt;, where a prophecy that Oedipus would kill his father and marry his mother causes him to be sent away at birth, which in turn eventually enables that prophecy to be fulfilled (Oedipus wouldn't have done those things if he recognized his parents). But this is a comedy, and in accordance with Plato's critique of drama (also in the &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;), Calderón seems to be critiquing the Oedipal view of fate as slander against God. It's not the case that good people are fated to horrible ends despite their best efforts; it's not that our characters are fixed, with a tragic flaw that will inevitably lead to our downfall. Yes, God is all-knowing, so it's hard not to admit into that world-view the idea that he knows what you're going to do, i.e., you in that sense have a destiny. But you still have free will; you can change, and if you do the right thing, you'll likely do well.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The play doesn't deal with the problem of evil that these thoughts naturally raise; it just warns us against screwing things up by overthinking them in the sense of taking actions specifically to avoid what you take to be your destiny.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Much of the second half of our discussion focuses on the idea of "meta-theater," which is where a dramatic work shows off its nature to the audience as dramatic work. This is also related to Plato's critique of drama: That it's escapist, that it fools us into believing in the figments it presents, which can involve morally undesirable messages as in the view of the gods in &lt;em &gt;Oedipus &lt;/em &gt;. Drama that shows its own artifice allows the viewer to retain a certain distance from it: It allows you to think for yourself and not take the presented views as reality (see &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-212-sartre-on-25790525" target="_blank"&gt;Sartre on literary manipulation &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There are many ways to do this, and it's very common in modern theater where the ability to break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience provides a key advantage that live theater has over mass media. The classic example is a play within a play (as in &lt;em &gt;Hamlet &lt;/em &gt;, which is of course a tragedy and subject to Plato's critique, so let's just say that meta-theater can be used for this critique but doesn't necessarily imply it), and the idea that "all the world's a stage." (Read &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world's_a_stage" target="_blank"&gt;on Wikipedia &lt;/a &gt;re. the full Shakespeare quote about that as well as its origins in Erasmus and elsewhere.) So, how does that sentiment compare to Segismundo's pronouncement that life is a dream? Both involve life's activities being in some sense illusory, not having the import or ultimate context that we take them to have. Life's being a stage and not just a dream also adds the element of a potential audience, which for Calderón (and probably not for Shakespeare) would be God. Living in a religious culture for thousands of years has given many of us—even those who no longer believe in God—the habit of acting as if in front of this audience, of taking the contents of our minds seriously, as of objective and not merely a matter of personal whim. Whenever we think that it's motive and not results that matter in ethics, whenever we try à la &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/11/11/ep84-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;Nietzsche &lt;/a &gt;to live life as an art, whenever we create art for art's sake, we're imbuing an experience that could be nihilistic with some intrinsic value, as if it were happening on a stage in front of an omnipotent judge.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, at the end of the discussion here, you get to hear a bit about the rest of the cast and what Bill and Erica are up to professionally.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Pulling Apart" by &lt;a href="https://music.jsegel.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Segel &lt;/a &gt;.

How does the end of the show affect its overall political message? Was it really (as George R.R. Martin depicted) about the irreducible complexity of politics (given that any character named or unnamed can actually make a difference, at least destructively) or qua TV Show is it forced to zero-in, Sweathogs-like (I refer of course to &lt;em &gt;Welcome Back, Kotter &lt;/em &gt;where amazingly in a full class of students only four of them could apparently talk), on a select set of powerful characters that we are meant to identify with? (See our ep. on fame with Lucy Lawless  for more on my theory of why this might be the case: insofar as the show is presenting archetypes of power, we can only handle a very limited number of them; our psychology is aristocratic.) Also, does it make sense to be performing feminist critiques on a show based on the premise of people murdering each other for power?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks for your support, which allows us to record this kind of bonus content.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Aldous Huxley’s 1932 dystopian novel, recorded on stage with an audience Q &amp;amp;A at Manhattan's Caveat on 4/6/19.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If we harness the power of society to employ available technologies to really focus on making people happy, what would the result be? This is Huxley's thought experiment, drawing on the latest thinking (and a bit of sci-fi projection regarding possible future advances) in mass-production techniques (via Henry Ford, whose thought is treated as religion by the society the novel depicts), behaviorist conditioning, education (including sleep learning), embryology (he predicated cloning), eugenics, pharmacology (the drug soma, that has no negative side effects), and psychotherapy (including removal of troublesome parental relations and encouragement of childhood sex play). Some of these ideas had previously been synthesized by Bertrand Russell in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://ia802608.us.archive.org/16/items/scientificoutloo030217mbp/scientificoutloo030217mbp.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Scientific Outlook &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1931, particularly chapter 15), which Huxley liberally borrows from.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So this is a test case for utilitarianism, but like all test cases for big ideas, it's somewhat inconclusive. First, this is apparently a dystopia, but Huxley seems not so sure. While he certainly didn't like the caste system and totalitarianism he depicts and sincerely bemoaned the loss of human autonomy (see &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/alasBxZsb40" target="_blank"&gt;this 1958 interview &lt;/a &gt;where he predicts that the brave new world is closer than ever given increasing overpopulation and bureaucratization), he also didn't think that simply rejecting all these new technologies and insights was a feasible solution either, because the challenges we face (again, chiefly overpopulation) are real and require our ingenuity and not any kind of return to primitivism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Second and relatedly, is the idea of making people happy using technology fundamentally faulty, or was it just not implemented in the right way here? As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_INFQP28YA" target="_blank"&gt;I argue &lt;/a &gt;, a utilitarianism like &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/09/18/episode-9-utilitarian-ethics-what-should-we-do/" target="_blank"&gt;Bentham's &lt;/a &gt;focused on pleasure instead of flourishing is impoverished. Making us "happy" isn't just a matter of feeding our pleasure centers, much less killing off the more spiritual parts of us so that pleasure becomes our only possible requirement for happiness. (The Epicureans seemed to think that all this extra "spiritual" worrying was just pretentious anyway, that focusing on physical pleasure and freedom from worry is the only real human good.) If we accept (following Nietzsche) that human fulfillment is too complex to mass produce, does entail instead a hands-off, libertarian attitude where as a society we simply stop trying to make people happy? To me, that seems unduly pessimistic: there are plenty of things we can try to reduce the common causes of unhappiness, even if that's not itself sufficient to guarantee universal happiness.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan are all here to discuss how Huxley tries to convey his ideas, what roles the various characters in the novel play, whether this is a critique of capitalism or communism (neither!), how this relates to our current social ills, and more. Featuring audience participation by Jesse, Scott, Zoe, Avi, Brenda (Dylan's wife!), Dan (from Phi Fic!), Toby, and two guys at the end that didn't say their names.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the remainder of Friedrich Nietzsche’s &lt;em &gt;Thus Spoke Zarathustra &lt;/em &gt;(1885).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How can we keep our spirits up and avoid nihilism? After all (says Nietzsche), there's no God or other transcendent purpose-giving entity to guarantee that life is worth living. There's just our complex animality, with its cycles of desire, satiation, and more desire, with our in-built character and maybe the capacity to self-overcome, with our idiosyncrasies that yes, can be parlayed into living artistically but which tend to leave us as freakish even when we manage to rise above the herd.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start off following last episode by returning to the book 2 section "On Poets" and reflecting on why Nietzsche chooses to write in this style? Following Plato, he says that poets "lie too much," but in the same section he counts himself a poet too. So what makes it more effective for Nietzsche to use allegory and jokes and shifting advice than to just write down a straightforwardly expository philosophy?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We then move to book 3, where Zarathustra travels back from the world where he preached to his mountain cave, so we get a bit of a travelogue of his moodiness. Will he (and the world!) be overcome with the "spirit of gravity," or will he like his pet eagle soar to the heights? What are we to make of these persistent metaphors? One pervasive theme in this book is the notion of eternal recurrence, which is the elaboration of the "solution" to nihilism presented at the end of book 2, i.e. coming to peace with the past. First, this is a scary prospect, because if everything recurs, then suffering recurs, pettiness recurs. But eventually he's able to accept the idea, because moments of joy (of feeling your creative power) are what life is all about, i.e. they justify all the suffering and pettiness in between, and "joy wants eternity."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So has Nietzsche violated his own passion against "otherworldliness" by emphasizing this cosmological picture, in which, yes, the world of our experience does occur (many times!) but is transmogrified by this transcendental structure (meaning that we don't actually experience events as recurring)? Is eternal recurrence actually true, and would we even actually care if it were? In &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/11/11/ep84-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;The Gay Science &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, his treatment of the topic was brief and hypothetical: a mind game where you imagine, before you perform an action, that it'll recur infinitely many times... would you still want to do it? In the present work, he seems to be taking the notion more seriously, recounting through his tale of Zarathustra the real-life-changing effect that this idea was purported to have had on Nietzsche.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Eternal recurrence is introduced right near the beginning of book 3, and that book ends with the climax with the full implications of that idea being realized and accepted. In between, we get more commentary, including the longest section of the whole book "On the Old and New Tablets," which lays out ideas requisite for being able to create new values. You must recognize that current concepts of good and evil that seem so firm only seem that way because your soul (and culture) are in a wintry, frozen state. We must "become hard" and "be evil enough for [the] truth," which is that these things are not fixed foundations for our lives, but works forever in progress: "There have been only illusions so far, not knowledge, about good and evil." Killing and robbing we dismiss as totally evil, but "is there not in all life itself killing and robbing?" Our honor should not be rooted where we come from, but where we are going. We firstlings (the first ones to take seriously this challenge to traditional values) are sacrifices to future philosophy, because we'll inevitably harmed by those who take themselves to be already good (just like Socrates was killed by the Athenians he challenged).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We don't talk much here about book 4, which Nietzsche did not originally intend to be the end, but just an interlude. It's the most overtly comic, and displays a variety of "higher men" like a king, a retired pope, a magician, a voluntary beggar, the ugliest man, and one who calls himself a shadow, all of whom come to become Zarathustra's new disciples, but they end up worshipping an ass who brays "Yeah-yuh!" (as in Exodus where the Israelites receive the ten commandments but then start worshipping a golden calf) These represent various ways that people can misinterpret Nietzsche's teachings, only internalizing part of what he's trying to convey. So Nietzsche says "say yes to life!" and maybe you interpret that in a stupid way, saying yes to everything when Nietzsche has also stressed that there's a lot of crap out there that you need to say "no" to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The point is that wisdom is complex and fleeting. Were one to try to express it in simple, expository prose, it would inevitably escape, because every circumstance is different, things keep changing, people's natures differ, and consequently, every piece of wise advice also needs wisdom to apply it properly.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679601759/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0679601759 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=c0d18ac2e6854fe29249cfd1ca0e7991" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the Walter Kaufmann translation &lt;/a &gt;(this is also in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140150625/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140150625 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=47cddda5ed412e88903f9fd531140578" target="_blank"&gt;The Portable Nietzsche &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, or try &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/ThePortableNietzscheWalterKaufmann" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The secondary sources cited in this episode are Walter Kaufmann's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691160260/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691160260 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=27d27a73116c28b7ad33e21e62196de6" target="_blank"&gt;Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, T.K.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Friedrich Nietzsche’s &lt;em &gt;Thus Spoke Zarathustra &lt;/em &gt;, books 1 and 2 (1883).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is wisdom? In Nietzsche's most famous book, he gives us his own Socrates, his own avatar to engage the foolish populace, though instead of asking them questions, Zarathustra tends to preach, and the whole book has a very Biblical tone, except more cagey. You see, this is a book "for all and none," meaning that Nietzsche doesn't think most of you will understand when he has Zarathustra state that man is something that shall be overcome or mentions in passing that God is dead, and he's not going to patiently explain it to you either.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is definitely a book of ethics, but the principles enumerated are very general and can be hard to translate into practical action: "be faithful to the earth," "love with a great contempt," "listen to the voice of the healthy body," "where one can no longer love, there one should pass by," "become hard!" Also, since Nietzsche is a virtue ethicist, he can use the trick of just saying what the overman (his ethical ideal) does, without necessarily implying that YOU can become that ideal and so "give birth to a dancing star."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What also complicates this is that, unlike Aristotle, Nietzsche does not think that human virtue is just one thing, a fulfillment of our inborn, common human nature whose development is amenable to common methods of training. Instead, we get psychological insights that serve as general advice: For instance, be sure to have friends (and enemies!) that challenge you. Don't get wrapped up in other people's misfortune such that you neglect yourself. Definitely don't tie yourself (like through marriage) to someone who is vapid. Respect your indiosynracies, your personal passions, and nurture these into virtues. Don't seek joy, but seek challenge and hardship, and joy will come.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Each person's creative journey of self-overcoming will be individual, and a lot of what we see in the book is the general pattern of Nietzsche's own moodiness: He needs to be alone, then he needs other people to talk to. He needs to wander, but then needs to come back home. He needs to soar creative heights, but then needs to sleep for days at a time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These two books contain a lot of trenchant critique, though almost never with actual names attached. He accuses his (former) fellow professors of being sterile: unable to create. He calls priests "prisoners of false values and deluded words." He criticizes pessimists, i.e. the "preachers of death" who declare that "life is refuted" when they see "a sick man or an old man or a corpse" as seeing only one face of existence. He criticizes metaphysicians (the "afterworldly") who want to "reach the ultimate with one leap" as displaying "a poor ignorant weariness that does not want to want any more," declaring that "this created all gods and afterworlds." He criticizes "blockheads" who see values as fixed components of nature (the mistake of the historical Zarathustra).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A particularly fruitful negative image to come out of the book is the "Last Man," who is perhaps the natural consequence of the seemingly commendable desire to figure out and address human suffering. If there is a definable teleological goal, i.e. happiness, that all people share, we should be able to figure out what stands in the way of this and engineer society to maximize this, so that individuals no longer have to do any work in achieving it, and can just rest easy in their virtue and reasonableness. This seems to highlight the difference between utilitarianism and Nietzsche's ethics, but only if the "happiness" that utilitarianism is trying to maximize is clearly defined, e.g. in terms of pleasure. If you instead interpret happiness as "flourishing" and admit Nietzsche's point that this will vary to some degree between individuals, and that it necessarily involves creativity, including and especially creativity regarding values, then it may still be sensible to try to intentionally construct a society that maximizes the opportunity for as many people as possible to pursue self-actualization in this way, instead of declaring that "the earth is full of the superfluous" and focusing only on exceptionally bright and hardy individuals.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan join here to make our way slowly through the Prelude of the book, where we meet the Overman, Last Man, the tightrope walker that represents the seeker as bridge between man and Overman, the jester that leaps over the tightrope walker, an old hermit in the woods, gravediggers, and more. Half-way in, we finally move to book one to hear Zarathustra's most important speeches, jump to talking about his views on the state ("On the New Idol"), and wrap up by discussing the Will to Power as the will to overcome oneself by reconciling oneself with the past: "to recreate all 'it was' into 'thus I willed it." ("On Redemption").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For episode 214, we'll finish the work (reading books 3 and 4) and discuss his explicit guidance on how to do this: embrace the notion of eternal recurrence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679601759/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0679601759 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=c0d18ac2e6854fe29249cfd1ca0e7991" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the Walter Kaufmann translation &lt;/a &gt;(this is also in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140150625/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140150625 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=47cddda5ed412e88903f9fd531140578" target="_blank"&gt;The Portable Nietzsche &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, or try &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/ThePortableNietzscheWalterKaufmann" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can also &lt;a href="https://librivox.org/thus-spake-zarathustra-by-friedrich-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;listen to the book in full &lt;/a &gt;, albeit in an older translation.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Jean-Paul Sartre's &lt;em &gt;What is Literature &lt;/em &gt;(1948), ch. 1 and 2.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the purpose of literature? Why write prose as opposed to poetry? Sartre was fending off criticism that his prose was too overtly political. Kant's view of art was still dominant, according to which good art is "disinterested," i.e. the spectator is supposed to appreciate the pure play of form. So if an artist is playing instead on your sentiments or your moral intuitions, that's impure, and likely cheap and manipulative.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In chapter one ("What is Writing?"), Sartre responds to this by distinguishing poetry from prose. In poetry (or painting or music), the focus is on the words (colors, sounds) themselves: How do the words sound? Prose, like any other kind of expository writing, uses words in their more usual manner, which is as signs that refer to things. What we care about in prose is communicating what we want to say, whereas in poetry, the point is entirely how you say it. To be sure, poetry is playing with words as signifiers, not as mere marks on a page (or sounds in the air), but language is in this case not being &lt;em &gt;used &lt;/em &gt;. Sartre describes the poet as someone who refuses to merely use language, who pretends to be a stranger to ordinary language use in order to shift focus back from the signified ideas to the signifiers themselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In prose, on the other hand, style needs to serve the topic. You have to actually have something to say. Sartre is very critical of the cult of "great books" that embraces dead authors for their style while ignoring their practical exhortations (after all, what are we going to actually do in response to an ancient Greek author's opinion about the Peloponnesian War?), and then uses this as a template for how to treat living writers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Chapter two ("Why Write?") continues the treatment of prose, giving a fascinating phenomenology of writing and reading. If you're a writer, your work never appears as a finished, transcendent object. When you look at it (unless a long time has passed), you re-enter the writing process, so you recall where passages came from, and everything looks like you could just reach out and change it further. For a reader, a work appears as finished, transcendent, an object in the world, but also incomplete, and waiting for the reader to come along and flesh it out. For a bunch of words on a page to become a coherent work, a person needs to connect the various statements into a sensible narrative. If the book is depicting emotional content, it's the reader's emotional experience that makes that content come to life: The reader's cognitive and emotional limitations will limit the power of what can come out of the work. So reading is a synthesis of perception on the one hand, but also creation, albeit directed by the author. This idea fleshes out the role of the reader as we considered when we read Barthes ("The Death of the Author") and Foucault ("What Is an Author?") back in episode 189.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Sartre turns this picture of the cooperative relationship between the writer and reader into an ethical one. A work of prose presents itself as an appeal: "Please finish creating me by reading with your whole soul." It is an appeal to the reader's freedom, because of course the reader can at any time throw down the book, must voluntarily suspend disbelief where the conventions of the genre require, and more generally, on Sartre's conception, interpretation is what freedom is primarily about. Sartre agrees with Kant insofar as the book should not be heavy handed to the point of emotional manipulation: It should not tell you exactly what to feel, and should not try to force moral conclusions on you. Prose is, again, primarily about revealing something, and so presents this ethical challenge to the reader to hear what's being said and recognize its truth. So prose is necessarily political. One implication of this view is that a good work can't be fundamentally false or evil: You can't write a good work preaching an anti-semitic message, for instance, for exactly the reasons described in our last episode: the anti-semitic attitude, by denying the freedom of all concerned, is fundamentally dishonest and false, so you can't use prose to effectively reveal its truth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan spend a lot of time trying to get Sartre's philosophy of art straight, which is confusing and problematic: It would seem to pit him against all hybrids of poetry and prose, e.g. classical theater (Shakespeare and Sophocles are certainly filled with ideas and not just about the sounds of the words) and Lucretius (who is giving us poetry but expressly saying that the poetic form is just a tool to make the otherwise potentially boring ideas about physics and such go down easier).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;And bringing in other art forms seems to make things more complicated. For example, poetry clearly differs from painting; zooming back from what a word signifies to the word itself is comparable to but interestingly different from zooming back from what a painted image depicts to the painting itself. Would photography then be the prose of image-making whereas painting is the poetry? This analogy helps undermine Sartre's claims in this work: Just as photography can be artistic, can be all about the image itself rather than about what is depicted (e.g. used for identifying a criminal through his image captured by a security camera), prose can be primarily artistic. The referential character of language makes it more able than any visual art for conveying ideas, but this will be just as true for poetry as for prose, as Sartre's own analysis of poetry in "Black Orpheus" makes clear. Perhaps, contra Sartre, artistically good prose is closer to poetry than it is to a treatise.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There's also plenty to question in chapter two: Is this act of reading truly creative, in that different readers will create different works out of the same writing, or is it more a matter that different readers will more or less be able to appreciate the writer's singular work? Is Sartre in casting the challenge of an unread book as an ethical appeal being over-dramatic? He actually presents an artwork as an "end" (i.e. a purpose lying there to be achieved) comparably to how Kant's ethics treats people as ends. This shows both how Sartre's ethics follows Kant's (acting authentically for Sartre necessarily involves acknowledging the freedom of the Other) and how Sartre differs (Kant absolutely affirms the is-ought distinction, whereas for Sartre, things in our experience constantly make ethical appeals to us, and these truth-revelations made by books provide an example of that, so either the fact (the "is") that is revealed does imply in us an ought, or perhaps a better analysis is facts are inherently value-laden (not, at least in some cases, a pure "is"). So this ends up being a more complicated, interesting, and controversial book than one might expect from a work that appears to be merely addressing criteria for good art.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415254043/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0415254043 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=8f7228761517af5411e6475c4ef53d4f" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415254043/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0415254043 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=8f7228761517af5411e6475c4ef53d4f" target="_blank"&gt;What is Literature?&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or try &lt;a href="http://faculty.weber.edu/ccall2/images/interests/WorldLit/WhatIsLiterature.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Things I Shouldn't Have Told You" by Sam Phillips, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem90-sam-phillips/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #90 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;PEL Live is this Saturday 4/6 4-6pm Eastern time!

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Jean-Paul Sartre's &lt;em &gt;Anti-Semite and Jew: An Exploration of the Etiology of Hate &lt;/em &gt;(1946) and "Black Orpheus" (1948).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These are the essays that Frantz Fanon (see &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/02/24/ep210-fanon-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 210 &lt;/a &gt;) was most responding to, and they address the same question: How can we best psychologically understand racism and reactions to it? Sartre's chief analytical tool is the accusation of inauthenticity: The anti-Semite believes self-evident lies in order to avoid accepting the truth of his human condition of freedom, while the oppressed may themselves fail to authentically acknowledge their situation in various ways, whereas the keys to their liberation are, well, yes, of course removing the racist condition, but first acknowledging it and finding the consequent "soul" of your people, which will itself put one in the best position to fight the injustice.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;Anti-Semite and Jew &lt;/em &gt;first delves into the phenomenon of anti-Semitism, and his target is the idea that one can be an otherwise decent person but also want society purged of Jews. He analyzes anti-Semitism as a "passion" that is constitutive of someone's being; it demonstrates a fundamentally corrupt way of viewing humanity that can't be simply compartmentalized. It's a sentimental attitude, alleging a magical, native bond with the French land that a Jew or other "foreigner" has no access to. This allows the anti-Semite to feel superior even though he may lack wealth, intelligence, or other distinction. The hatred of Jews is not a rational conclusion based on observations like the prevalence of Jews in positions of power or wealth; these are merely adduced after the fact to support an attitude already committed to. This attitude is black-and-white, identifying the Jew as the embodiment of evil. Any apparent virtues the Jew may possess don't actually count as virtues when the Jew possesses them; they just make him more dangerous.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So anti-Semitism denies human freedom, both of the Jew who is taken as essentially evil, and of the anti-Semite himself, who is claimed to have essential value without having to do anything to achieve this. It shirks the responsibility of building society by putting all the blame for social ills on a demonized "other."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The latter half of the book deals with Jews themselves and the issues that Sartre had with how many of his highly assimilated, intellectual Jewish friends dealt with anti-Semitism. To be authentic, the Jew should live his full condition as a Jew, not deny or seek to escape it. So if a Jew tries to hide his Judaism, he just (in the anti-Semite's mind) confirms anti-Semitism: he's a self-hating Jew, so there must be some reason to hate Jews. Because he has been denied this intangible "ownership" of France and its privileges by anti-Semites, he might be extra ambitious or avaricious so as to literally own more of France and to make his way into high society. According to Sartre, this is still fundamentally reactive; it's letting the anti-Semite into your head to set one's life's goals in some way. Sartre recommends that Jews stand together and form political bonds to fight anti-Semitism, and he recommends some political measures like education and restriction of anti-Semitic speech, but he states at the end that the necessary and sufficient way to fix the problem is Marxist economic revolution to eradicate social class.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In &lt;em &gt;Anti-Semite and Jew &lt;/em &gt;, Sartre makes clear that any oppressed minority can serve the role of the Jew. "Black Orpheus" covers similar ground as the latter half of that book, but for a different purpose: He's providing the introduction to a book of poetry by black writers from French-colonized lands. He considers the poetry as fundamentally political, in that it uses the French language against itself and exposes "the black soul," i.e., negritude, which is not any essential quality that all black people have, but an attitude that expresses the condition of being oppressed in this personal way. Discovering this negritude provides an authentic way to be instead of being defined by the oppressor.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Sartre explains that this black poetry of his time is the only truly revolutionary poetry, that the "technical" character of the white working class (using the means of production to try to increase his power in the workplace) does not lend itself to song in this way. Just as with the Jew, the eventual goal is to get society beyond the need to recognize such differences: Humanistically, each individual should just be considered in his full freedom. But one can't just declare, now (and much less so, of course, in Sartre's time), that we live in a post-racial society and demand a color-blind world, as this denies the situation of racism that has picked out the oppressed group. Instead, Sartre recommends a "concrete liberalism" that respects individuals not just qua individuals but qua members of oppressed groups, and on an individual psychological level, embracing negritude (or Jewish, or American Indian, or whatever) identity is a necessary step in authentically coping.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In a lengthy discussion over two days, Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan try to figure out whether Sartre's analyses ring true and how to apply them to the present day.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805210474/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0805210474 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=01bafda01340b25036456e0d7f5ee510" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805210474/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0805210474 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=01bafda01340b25036456e0d7f5ee510" target="_blank"&gt;Anti-Semite and Jew &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="http://abahlali.org/files/Jean-Paul_Sartre_Anti-Semite_and_Jew_An_Exploration_of_the_Etiology_of_Hate__1995.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2708701339/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=2708701339 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=b1c6888759cc8490418ad32425489b55" target="_blank"&gt;Buy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2708701339/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=2708701339 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=b1c6888759cc8490418ad32425489b55" target="_blank"&gt;Black Orpheus &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="http://massreview.org/sites/default/files/Sartre.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Punch Bag" by Godley &amp;amp; Creme as discussed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem3-kevin-godley-pure-play-in-the-devils-shoes/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #3 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.caveat.nyc/event/the-partially-examined-life-philosophy-podcast-10th-anniversary-live-recording-on-aldous-huxleys-brave-new-world-4-6-2019" target="_blank"&gt;See PEL Live in NYC on April 6 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

We focused on the preface and chapters 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Fanon was tasked with helping patients with their anxieties, but found that the cause of their anxieties was in many cases their social situation: their status as persecuted, marginalized, demonized, and ignored. What was needed was not just to get people comfortable in such a messed up situation, but to help them see the reality of this situation and on the one hand "decolonize" their minds to lessen the effect of this poison, and on the other hand to urge people to join the struggle in addressing these social problems.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He doesn't use the term "marginalization," but he describes in great detail how the center of culture in the French-speaking world was of course France, and colonized people all spoke French and looked to France for historical and intellectual inspiration. To aspire for a black person was in that culture to aspire to be more like whites. As someone who aroused fear and suspicion in whites, Fanon reflects on how even his sense of his own body is tainted by excess self-consciousness: seeing himself as how he looks from a white gaze that he has internalized. Even when his white colleagues praise him as an individual, their praise is tainted by their (actual or presumed) bigotry toward blacks as a group.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There had already been for a couple of decades a "negritude" movement that was supposed to counter this feeling of marginalization, to provide an alternate source of values and pride, to enable people of African descent to feel solidarity, unearth their "black souls," and unite in their struggle. Fanon was influenced by this, but this was complicated by his embrace of existentialism, which says that there are no "essences" of individuals, much less "races." So just as blacks are not what the bigots claim they are, neither is there an authentic "black soul" to be uncovered. What Fanon called "anti-racist-racism" is an important and perhaps a necessary tool for reversing the evil effects of colonization and bigotry, but is ultimately a stage to be overcome. To define oneself in opposition to bigotry is still to let bigotry set the agenda; the ultimate goal is a post-racial state of mind and society. As existentialist, Fanon claimed himself free of any kind of racial destiny or obligation, though as a matter of fact, he subsequently aided the Algerians in their struggle for independence from the French.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A recurring issue in our discussion was the question as to whether Fanon should be called a humanist. Should the larger takeaway be the need for black solidarity (in which case he's &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;a humanist, and would regard humanism as covert racism: the attempt to universalize the practices and outlook of the dominant class and call that "human"), or the goal of a post-racial future where everyone is evaluated and receives dignity purely as an individual without any regard for group identifications or historical injustices?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Since we're all human, we all face the existential anguish of our utter freedom, but Fanon thought that the black colonized experience required that blacks be treated to remove the complexes specific to being a member of a persecuted group before they could realize that freedom. But of course, aren't all of us in various ways conditioned by our upbringing, told that we are such and such and should do this and that, so that some kind of enlightenment is needed to reveal this existential situation? The bigot himself has been raised to believe he is superior; surely this complex needs dispelling. Or is the fact that this existential "human condition" is almost universally concealed from us until we read about existentialism maybe more of an indication that the existentialist is actually telling a made-up story, and that we're not as free as Fanon (following Sartre) claims?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802143008/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0802143008 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=0bce8ecc14023990e5a9d09633e01b2d" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://abahlali.org/files/__Black_Skin__White_Masks__Pluto_Classics_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One of the most influential commentators on Fanon is Lewis Gordon, whom you can see talking about it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-cVcOi-Env2s-k4x5tHy4JbXamRDUDY4" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We interview &lt;a href="https://fukuyama.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Francis Fukuyama &lt;/a &gt;about his 2018 book &lt;em &gt;Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment &lt;/em &gt;and then continue the discussion on our own.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What motivates people? Economists point to desire, and to rationality as a way of efficiently getting what we desire. Frank says this misses out on the third aspect of the soul that Plato identified in the &lt;em &gt;Republic &lt;/em &gt;: &lt;em &gt;thymos &lt;/em &gt;, or spiritedness. Our thymos makes us demand dignity, often in preference to having material desires fulfilled; a lot of the "irrational" behavior that economists and political scientists find hard to explain is a result of this quest for social recognition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In Part III of Frank's breatthrough book &lt;em &gt;The End of History and The Last Man &lt;/em &gt;(1992), he explained the philosophical history of thymos and defined the end of history (i.e., the thing that political history has been aiming at) as the achievement of &lt;em &gt;isothymia &lt;/em &gt;, i.e., everyone receiving the recognition that is their due, and so everyone having in that sense the same social status. A liberal democracy, even if it has de facto economic classes, grants everyone the same status under the law, and culturally, we do not (or are not supposed to) think that differences in observable characteristics like wealth, education, ethnic background, or behavioral patterns add up to one class of people being "better" than another.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The new book applies this theory to our modern political situation, where the demand for identification is no longer just a matter of recognizing the individual as a dignified individual, but recognizing the individual as a member of a group that is itself worthy of esteem. Many Muslims worldwide feel that Islam has been under attack. People of African descent in previously colonized and/or slave-holding lands point to historical injustices and lingering white privilege. Rural Americans may feel left behind by progress and disrespected by media elites. Minorities often want to hold on to their cultures instead of assimilating.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;Identity &lt;/em &gt;gives an intellectual history of this demand and discusses the tendency for isothymia (again, the demand for equal respect) to slide into &lt;em &gt;megalothymia &lt;/em &gt;(the demand to be recognized as superior). He points to Luther and the Protestant Reformation as for the first time spreading among the masses the idea that their inside—their thoughts, feelings, and beliefs—is the seat of what matters. He then describes Rousseau as secularizing that notion: that it's not our equality before God that matters, but that we must demand that society recognize each one of us as a full, dignified individual. In both of these cases, what made the individual worthy of respect (in a way that an animal, for instance, is not) was his or her ability to act as a free moral agent, but in the twentieth century, "self-esteem" movements removed this requirement: We are all special, whatever our characteristics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;However, Frank points to a tension between this unconditional regard for every individual and actually having values. He was a student of Allan Bloom and shares Bloom's apprehension about Nietzsche and the threat of moral relativism to social cohesion. In order to have a functioning democracy, both of these thinkers claim, we need to have a social ethic that promotes democratic ideals. So an individual with cultural roots that involve an antidemocratic ideology should therefore be persuaded, if possible, to assimilate to the extent required to promote this shared commitment to democratic equality. Also, the democratic ethic itself cannot decay into mere respect for pluralism; more positive social connections are needed for democracy to function well. Things don't work if each group is siloed, with their news filtered to represent only the opinions of their group, demonizing other groups, fixated on their personal grievances (the past or present infringements of their group's dignity).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Frank's solution is that we need to channel this psychological need to identify with groups to promote civic participation: Our identities should be creedal instead of ethnic (more of an issue in Europe, where "being a Norwegian" seems to rule out folks of different ethnic backgrounds than "being an American"). We need to recognize and address the legitimate issues of past group discrimination but always look forward to ways to politically and culturally unify instead of getting lost in past resentments. (Note that this is coming from a guy with relatives who were held in internment camps during WWII.) We need to guard against megalothymia both where individual leaders want to be recognized as superior and where groups want to assert their superiority over other groups.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan engage Frank on these issues, then continue to delve into the philosophy involved: For instance, Fukuyama (I'm shifting to his last name because we're now talking about, not with, him—a weird convention but one I'm willing to defend) takes this "demand for recognition" issue as coming from Hegel (or rather Kojeve's interpretation of Hegel, which is much easier to understand than reading Hegel directly; see our discussion of Hegel's master-slave dynamic), and seems to claim in &lt;em &gt;The End of History &lt;/em &gt;that this dynamic whereby one puts one's life on the line in a struggle for recognition not only gets the ball rolling with regard to historical political systems (which contra Hobbes don't begin with a "contract" but with domination) but also is constitutive of human self-consciousness itself. To recognize yourself as someone with an inner life may also necessarily mean that you recognize yourself as having an innate dignity, which then should be recognized by others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The focus on thymos also gives us a different perspective on ethics: To make any ethical claim is not just to point at an external rule of conduct, but (in many cases, at least) to make a dignity claim, i.e., to assert oneself (which could amount to asserting one's group) as a determinant of value. For instance, many opponents of gay marriage still supported full legal equality through civil unions for gay couples. This was not enough for proponents, who wanted social recognition, while opponents specifically wanted that recognition denied. This was less about the opponents being mean-spirited than wanting their world view (their group, their beliefs) to be the entity that was defining what is to be officially declared as being of value. So while "identity politics" seems like something not really of much centrality to philosophy to you, the notion of identity may well be pretty central to ethics and mentality itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There's also the question of how ideology infects political theory: We dismissed a lot of Bloom's grousing as old-man conservatism and claimed that one can recognize (as Bloom was arguing) the value of Western Great Books while still not being as critical of liberals as he was. Fukuyama has himself been called a former neoliberal (former because he didn't like Bush/Cheney's war-mongering); does this affect his judgments regarding what we should be aiming for in the area of civic unity? To what extent do his political beliefs really come out of his analysis as opposed to shaping the analysis itself? Is there a fundamental difference between a philosopher and a political commentator such that one really can't be both?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374129290/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374129290 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=864c97cd0a5a48557387d2d9665aa64c" target="_blank"&gt;Identity &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, and you should probably also buy &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743284550/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0743284550 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=7fd82f2a8ffad71df2c528c377112a10" target="_blank"&gt;The End of History and the Last Man &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, as that book is much more thorough and philosophical.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the extant fragments of Epicurus (341–270 BCE) dealing with ethics, including his "Letter to Menoceus" and collections known as “The Principal Doctrines” and “The Vatican Collection of Epicurean Sayings.”&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How are we supposed to act once we understand nature as we outlined in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-206-epicurean-23995157" target="_blank"&gt;episode 206 &lt;/a &gt;, i.e., atoms bouncing and swerving around in the void temporarily producing order through fortuitous collisions? There's no room in this picture for gods that tell us what to do, so our values are instead dependent on us, and not on our choice but on our nature.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Epicurus claimed that naturally, people pursue pleasure and avoid pain. This is the only reason we act at all; it is our motive force. But just as in the case of perception, we sometimes lose sight of the immediate data, and we get ideas that things like fame or extravagant wealth will bring us pleasure, when in fact these goals bring with them more pain both in the difficulty of obtaining them and in the end result when they are are obtained. Epicurus was even more down on sex than his follower Lucretius; this obvious pleasure brings with it too many difficulties to make it worth pursuing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This view presents obvious difficulties. First, how do we really know what behavior is "natural"? Epicurus points us to the behavior of animals and babies. They don't pursue socially engendered desires. However, they're not known for delayed gratification either, because they don't have reason like adults. Once you admit that reason is needed to wisely choose among potential pleasures, then there's room for a difference of opinion in exactly what is "natural" for an adult. One Epicurean can wholly shun social status, while another can claim that attaining a certain level of status is the only way to ensure security.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Second, what is "pleasure?" Epicurus thought that physical pleasures and pains are the basic, and that mental pleasures and pains are always referential to physical ones. Worries about death and loss are ultimately, on this view, worries about a physically painful experience. But does this view capture his support for friendship as a key good? First and foremost, he says, we need friends as a mutual support network; they can help us when times are bad. But we also simply enjoy their conversation, i.e.. the content of their ideas, and that doesn't sound very physical. Again, Epicurus prescribes a strict regimen whereby things like the love of philosophy and artistic endeavors shouldn't be pursued for their own sake, but only insofar as they help us achieve peace of mind. But once you allow that pleasures need not be physical, you're open to claims that things like philosophical curiosity or artistic enjoyment are basic pleasures.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Deciding that there can't be gods to boss us around might sound like is takes the pressure off: We can live how we want. But Epicurus thought that our wants are fundamentally distorted by social values, so serious interventions are needed to help us rediscover our "natural" selves, to see the wisdom of a quiet life free from vain exertions, and so he started The Garden, which was basically a cult to totally immerse people in his teachings and overcome any "irrational" attachments that members might have to their "vain" desires. Despite the supposed connection between this way of life and a proper scientific understanding of the physical world, they were not known as good scientists (as the Aristotelians were), because beyond the point of understanding Epicurus's conclusions and so attaining peace of mind (&lt;em &gt;ataraxia &lt;/em &gt;) scientific pursuits are vain. Likewise, they learned philosophy solely to defend Epicureanism against conflicting views, not to really understand those other views and try to objectively weigh their merits.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Of course, we observed with Stoicism that older thinkers like Epictetus had similarly strict views that were reinterpreted even in ancient times to allow various ways of life, but Epicurean views were systematically wiped out by the Catholic Church in a way that Stoic views were not, so the long historical tradition running up to the present day that Stoicism enjoys was cut short in the case of Epicureanism, leaving it much more to our imaginations and judgment as to what a contemporary Epicureanism should be like.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan try to sort through these and other issues using a couple of good secondary sources: Tim O’Keefe’s &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520264711/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0520264711 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=14a4a58782eac64d89c73fa5dc7d33a6" target="_blank"&gt;Epicureanism &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2010) and Martha Nussabum’s &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691181020/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691181020 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=8d253b6dcb0b6983beead82ea00fb1a2" target="_blank"&gt;The Therapy of Desire &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1994).

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;Sorry folks that the "follow-up" went up before this; something went wrong with the initial post two weeks ago, and I didn't realize it wasn't up since then. -ML &lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Lucretius’s poem about Epicurean science: &lt;em &gt;On &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;the &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;Nature &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;of &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;Things &lt;/em &gt;aka &lt;em &gt;De &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;Rerum &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;Natura &lt;/em &gt;from the first century BCE.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does the world work? Lucretius presents a system that is surprisingly modern, and raises philosophical issues that are still on point today: What are the basic building blocks of the universe? How could these give rise to minds? What ethical views does a mechanistic worldview imply?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We read all six books of the poem (supposedly cribbed from a 37-volume work of physics by Epicurus that is no longer extant), but concentrate most of our efforts on the beginning where he argues for atoms and void as the only things that ultimately exist. Epicurus took the atomism of Democritus and added a few things, such as the famed "swerve," whereby atoms don't just always move according to the the laws of physics but exert some independent initiative to slightly (and randomly) divert themselves; without this swerve, all atoms would just fall downward in parallel lines forever, but with it, we get the possibility of aggregation, of upward movement, and even free will (though that part really shouldn't follow from random movement). Also, while Democritus was a skeptic (only atoms are real, and atoms are really different than the macroscopic phenomena we actually see, right?), Epicurus argued that our senses are in fact never wrong, but only our interpretations of sensory data.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The poem argues that there must be a smallest part in nature that is eternal, or else things would inevitably fall apart completely. Anything composite involves atoms and the spaces between them, and these spaces provide locations for potential disconnection: everything falls apart eventually, everything dies. Since nothing comes from nothing (another foundational principle), and clearly there is something now, then there must be eternal elements that the dying things separate into, and these elements can then be reconstituted into other things. Lucretius argues that these must be an endless number of these atoms, and so there must be endless space for them to exist in: there is no center of the universe, and doubtless multiple worlds. For all intents and purposes, time is also endless, though Lucretius describes time as not actually a thing but just as a factor of motion: If there were no moving atoms, there would be no time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But these atoms aren't all alike; they have different sizes (though all are too small to be seen) and different textures, different numbers and shapes of protrusions. So, clearly, they aren't the smallest conceivable entity (the protrusions themselves are smaller), but they can't as a physical matter be split; you can't break off a protrusion. These different shapes and the combinations of different atoms explain macroscopic phenomena, often in hilariously literal ways, like loud shouts involve pointy atoms, which is why they make you hoarse and hurt people's ears.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;erception, then, has to be a matter of atoms flying through the air and interacting with our sense organs, and Lucretius uses the term "semblances" to describe patterns that reach us and that then can explain illusions. Likewise, dreams are semblances still echoing around inside us, and this brings us to the topic of illusions of the mind: mistakes we make about the world that negatively affect our attitudes. For instance, the cultural and biological idea of sexual love as an attempt to merge with another person (see Aristophanes's view in &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/08/15/ep100-plato-symposium/" target="_blank"&gt;Plato's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/08/15/ep100-plato-symposium/" target="_blank"&gt;Symposium &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;): that can never actually be achieved, and so just drives people crazy for no good reason.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A more pervasive illusion is that death is something to be feared. The mind, like everything else, is a composite of atoms (specifically air, breath, heat, and a nameless element of very small, fine atoms specific to the mind that are tightly knitted into the body), so once we die, these disperse: There can be no life of any sort after death. The fear of death results in imagining that after death there will be a person who is around to experience the results of this dispersion (or living on in an afterlife), but no, the dead person will not be around to experience this. It's also a mistake to mourn for the positive experiences you won't have: again, there's no one there to not have those experiences, no deprivation, so it's just us now working ourselves up unnecessarily.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The ethical ideal is &lt;em &gt;ataraxia &lt;/em &gt;, i.e., tranquility, and we can experience that if we get rid of this and the other sources of anxiety, like socially engendered desires for fame, for luxury, really for anything not ultimately reducible to basic experiences of bodily pleasure. Episode 208 will deal with Epicurus's ethical views directly, but there's one more relevant point to make here: A key source of anxiety, according to Lucretius, is our fear of vengeful gods that put demands on us. Clearly, on the view of physics described here, there is no room for such gods. Anything composite dies, so straightforwardly, there can be no gods at all (though Lucretius does not say this). If gods are immaterial (an option not actually left in Lucretius's physics), then they couldn't causally interact with physical things, and certainly don't direct the course of nature, which is instead ultimately a matter of the blind coincidence of atoms crashing into each other. The gods by definition have all they need: they can't be benefited by anything we do, and so can only serve for us as role models of tranquility.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080185055X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=080185055X &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a13f0519941c88f32b38d4e459ba4596" target="_blank"&gt;the Esolen translation we all read &lt;/a &gt;or you can &lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.html" target="_blank"&gt;read the text online &lt;/a &gt;or you can &lt;a href="https://librivox.org/on-the-nature-of-things-by-lucretius-2/" target="_blank"&gt;listen to it &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On essays in aesthetics by Johann Gottfried von Herder: “The Causes of Sunken Taste among the Different Peoples in Whom It Once Blossomed” (1775), “On the Influence of the Belles Lettres on the Higher Sciences” (1781), “Does Painting or Music Have a Greater Effect? A Divine Colloquy” (1785), and the sections about music and dance from the &lt;em &gt;Critical Forests: Fourth Grove &lt;/em &gt;(written 1769).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Seth are joined by rock legend, novelist, and &lt;a href="https://jugheadsbasementtnh.podomatic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;podcaster &lt;/a &gt;in his own right, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jughead_Pierson" target="_blank"&gt;John "Jughead" Pierson &lt;/a &gt;from the band that invented pop-punk, Screeching Weasel (and his subsequent band, Even in Blackouts, plus his participation in the theater company &lt;a href="https://neofuturists.org/" target="_blank"&gt;the Neo-Futurists &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;18th century Germany was a hotbed for the philosophy of art (they coined the word "aesthetics!") and the poet/critic/philosopher Herder was a key influence, at least until Kant's &lt;em &gt;Critique of Judgment &lt;/em &gt;totally re-oriented the debate in 1790. Herder coined the term "zeitgeist" (from a Latin term: genius saeculi, which means literally guardian spirit of the century) and our first essay, “The Causes of Sunken Taste among the Different Peoples in Whom It Once Blossomed," explored what made certain eras (classical Greece and Rome, the Renaissance, France under Louis XIV) so rife with artistic output. He chocked this up not only to individual genius artists channeling the striving force of nature, but to a high level of good taste among the cultured populace, which he tied to particular social factors, and traced how those same factors along with the internal logic of genius inevitably led to a decline in taste. For instance, someone creates a large, imposing statue that is very effective, and this leads to efforts to best it, to make things even larger until they're grotesque (i.e. in bad taste).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Herder was adamant that there must be an organic relationship between the works of a society and the roots of that society: that we should learn from the ancients, but that merely copying them is in bad taste. He pointed to Shakespeare and how he created a uniquely and modern English form of theater, and urged the Germans (who at that point weren't part of a single, united country with a national identity) to create comparable forms specific to their society's characteristics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Herder considered the relation between genius, taste, and reason, answering the age-old question of the relation between taste and virtue: While of course many actual artists focus all their energy on their art and so neglect the rest of their lives, really, artistic taste should form the model to cultivate your whole soul.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In our second essay, "On the Influence of the Belles Lettres on the Higher Sciences," Herder went on to consider aesthetic education. Much like &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/06/11/ep192-bloom-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Allan Bloom &lt;/a &gt;, he urged direct study of the classics, and stressed that this can't be just an intellectual exercise, but that we have to cultivate the senses. Herder's overall approach was very much empirical: We need to use the senses and an examination of history rather than a priori principles to determine the principles of aesthetics or any other aspect of philosophy. The "belles lettres," or popular writings of the day written for the sake of being pretty, could well serve as a primer for cultivating the skills that enable more abstract thought about weighty matters of philosophy, politics, etc.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;“Does Painting or Music Have a Greater Effect? A Divine Colloquy” compares the vividness of visual presentation with the deeper, more emotional effect of music. It's a dialogue featuring Apollo and the Muses, where the muses of Painting and Music are debating, and eventually Poetry is called in to be the mediator, and so Herder reveals that he thinks the addition of poetry helps music by making its lessons concrete (contra Kant who thought that music was polluted by imagery, whether brought in by lyrics or in some other way). Likewise, it's paintings that picture exalted themes (e.g. religious imagery) that are most effective: it's the presence of ideas and poetry behind the picture that really allow it it resonate with spectators. &lt;a href="https://imgc.allpostersimages.com/img/print/u-g-PGSFA20.jpg?w=900 &amp;amp;h=900 &amp;amp;p=0" target="_blank"&gt;Here's &lt;/a &gt;that New Yorker cartoon about the muses that Seth talks about.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We don't spend much time with &lt;em &gt;Critical Forests, Fourth Grove &lt;/em &gt;, but it's here that (following &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Gottlieb_Baumgarten" target="_blank"&gt;Alexander Baumgarden &lt;/a &gt;) he gets more specific about what an aesthetic education actually amounts to, and consequently what in music in particular he thinks is central, which is melody, not harmony. We didn't invent music by listening to birds, who we don't understand, but by expressing emotion, so the most primitive kind of music would be a shout, which is then refined over time into a melody, and it's this simple, distinct melody that we can all follow that is really what pierces our hearts according to Herder, the rest (the structure, the harmony) being merely additional decoration that can easily be overused, making the work less tasteful.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Putting the pieces together here, an education based in grasp of melody would engender using ideas clearly, rooting them firmly in experience, not running away with pretentious system-building.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Much of this should sound familiar to those who heard &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/07/06/ep119-1-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;our episode on Nietzsche's &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/07/06/ep119-1-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;Birth of Tragedy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, as he (a century later) engaged in a similar kind of social critique based on taste. Like Kant, Herder was trying to strike a balance between empiricism and rationalism, but Herder's thought was much more concrete and historical, anticipating post-Kantians like Nietzsche and Hegel.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can get all these essays in Herder's &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691115958/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691115958 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a55889e563f4803094654c9349cd2112" target="_blank"&gt;Selected Writings on Aesthetics &lt;/a &gt;, translated with a good introduction by Gregory Moore. &lt;a href="http://www.unsam.edu.ar/escuelas/humanidades/centros/c_cedeh/Johann_Gottfried.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A helpful supplement for understanding Herder's broader philosophy is his essay "&lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/herder/1772/origins-language.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Treatise on the Origin of Language &lt;/a &gt;" (1772). &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/xVPCZMWDXqs" target="_blank"&gt;Here's &lt;/a &gt;a lecture that John found on it that will give you the idea.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Dear Resonance" by John's band Even In Blackouts from his album &lt;em &gt;Zeitgeist's Echo &lt;/em &gt;(2005), Hear him interviewed about his music on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem58-john-jughead-pierson/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #58 &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes go into more textual detail re. Lucretius’s take on atomism and the metaphysical and epistemological problems it entails. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lucretius believes in something like entropy: all conjoined atoms eventually break apart, but his account of the mechanism by which they join is less spelled out: When you get two heat atoms together, does that make it more likely that a third heat atom will join them? If so, why? And if there is a powerful "conjoining" force that acts to counter the destroying force, how do these two tendencies balance each other given that there are actually no forces per se in Lucretius's system, only particles that have certain shapes?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are atoms the only things that are really real? Or are macroscopic objects also real, but in some different sense? Are colors, then, real? And how do these semblances work, these three-dimensional wispy (atomic, of course) outlines that fly through the air and hit our eyes? Can the other cases ever detect them, e.g., aren't there also aural illusions?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks for supporting the podcast and enabling us to have discussions like this!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We are rejoined by Drew Pinsky to discuss philosophical, psychological, and sociological readings on suicide.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is suicide ever morally permissible? If it's a symptom of mental illness rather than a chosen behavior, is it even appropriate to morally evaluate it?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/09/18/ep172-1-drew-pinsky/" target="_blank"&gt;Last time Drew joined us &lt;/a &gt;, he helped us add clinical depth to an area that we'd already talked about philosophically. For suicide, while Drew has dealt with hundreds of suicidal patients, we only had one previous episode for him to bring his expertise to bear on: &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/06/22/episode-4-camus-and-the-absurd/" target="_blank"&gt;#4 on Camus's "The Myth of Sisyphus" (1942)&lt;/a &gt;. We reread &lt;a href="http://thelightofreason.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/0/7/10077372/albert_camus_final.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this short version &lt;/a &gt;to reflect on the relationship between suicide and the meaning of life. For the rest, we tried to read widely from history:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;First, Dylan summarizes two letters by Seneca: 70. "&lt;a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_70" target="_blank"&gt;On the Proper Time to Slip the Cable &lt;/a &gt;"and 77. "&lt;a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_77" target="_blank"&gt;On Taking One's Own Life &lt;/a &gt;." As a Stoic, Seneca rejects the fear of death and says that what's important is not to keep living, but to live well, so suicide is morally permissible whenever the story of your life has reached its natural conclusion, when continuing to live would be dishonorable or otherwise not worth the effort.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Second, Seth talks about Arthur Schopenhauer's "&lt;a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Suicide" target="_blank"&gt;On Suicide &lt;/a &gt;," published in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614274088/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1614274088 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=6a170b50cad13b5ccadde80033591341" target="_blank"&gt;Studies in Pessimism &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1893). While Schopenhauer points back to the age of Seneca as having a more sensible attitude toward suicide than the Christians who considered it immoral, he also thinks it involves a mistake: You're being tormented by unfulfilled desire, and your task should be to withdraw from this kind of deceptive willfulness, whereas killing yourself is actually an exertion of your will, an attempt to improve your situation that actually leads to there being no situation left for you to improve.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes then takes us to Sigmund Freud's "&lt;a href="http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Freud_MourningAndMelancholia.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Mourning and Melancholia &lt;/a &gt;" (1915), which also depicts suicide as confused: We think of it as an attempt to escape suffering, but really it's an aggressive act, but toward an object—our image of another person—which we've taken into ourselves due to a fear of being angry at this other person. For more on this essay, listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sub-text-4-and-21956697" target="_blank"&gt;Wes's (sub)Text episode on it &lt;/a &gt;. To provide additional historical developments in psychoanalytic literature re. analyses of suicide, Wes also recommended "On the 'Longing to Die' " by Kate Friedlander (1938), "Suicide and the Hidden Executioner" by Stuart Asch (1977), and a 2009 survey, "Psychoanalytic Theories of Suicide" by Elsa Ronningstam et al.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;The first reading apart from Camus we identified for this episode was Emile Durkheim's groundbreaking work &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_(book)" target="_blank"&gt;Suicide &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1897), and we read his introduction plus Ch. 2 section IV, Ch. 3 section VI, and Ch. 5 sections II and III, which Mark quickly summarizes. This was pretty much the first work of modern sociology and sought correlations between suicide rates and social characteristics of suicides: sex, religion, country, marital status, economic status, etc. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140449671/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140449671 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=d20bac3bc3985cdb1d6d4d3a5df7865e" target="_blank"&gt;Buy it &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/DurkheimEmileSuicideAStudyInSociology2005/page/n3" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;. This book will be covered more thoroughly in the follow-up discussion on this episode between Mark and Wes. For a quick introduction to the book, try &lt;a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/sociology/socy-151/lecture-24" target="_blank"&gt;this lecture &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Looking for correlations, and hence risk factors and potential predictors, is pretty much what psychology is primarily concerned with in this area today, and we read two multi-author psychology articles from 2017: “&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000084.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Risk Factors for Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors: "A Meta-Analysis of 50 Years of Research &lt;/a &gt;” (2017) by Joseph C. Franklin et al, and “&lt;a href="https://nocklab.fas.harvard.edu/files/nocklab/files/cha-2017-annual_research_review_suicide_among.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Annual Research Review: Suicide Among Youth—Epidemiology, (Potential) Etiology, and Treatment &lt;/a &gt;” (2017) by Christine B. Cha et al. You may wish to listen to &lt;a href="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/142" target="_blank"&gt;this episode of the Very Bad Wizards podcast &lt;/a &gt;featuring Matthew Nock, who was a co-author on both of these papers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;To introduce us to the various philosophical questions involved in this topic and generate a few of the above readings, we read the &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suicide/" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on suicide &lt;/a &gt;by Michael Cholbi and the Wikipedia article on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_suicide" target="_blank"&gt;the philosophy of suicide &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;In those latter survey articles, you can see that there are many paths that we could have taken with this, and I also put out some feelers on Facebook (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/partiallyexaminedlife/permalink/10156740839679660/" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/partiallyexaminedlife/posts/2024555770934630?__xts__[0]=68.ARB6GeI1TvNJbHbDGjEL6irWm89pi4_L6JQzuqFX5QMWpJphzHApcvZVD4HttA2D4XLUdDT02QgcksQxrv2lIW6p809aPgJk5Iar3yDntb07bc3HO4cb95hg7_9e_zT_BrBaSVDoSyaTITG8f8_to5qe_jJ4NlvxrqnLZNAkTc57qXogUCrGszk0jXJHXgjlxxAXIPD2Imc &amp;amp;__tn__=-R" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;) that generated a lot of additional good suggestions. The basic issues of defining exactly what acts count as suicide and looking at the current political issues of right-to-die laws and physician-assisted suicide weren't of very much interest to us, as they're a bit too easy: Of course someone terminally ill should have the right to have a doctor help end his or her life, and we wouldn't morally condemn such a person. But if we admit that, then where's the dividing line in what situations are so bad that suicide is rational vs. the more ordinary situations of depression, anxiety, and often temporary states of risk? Are we ever in a position (in the absence of extreme circumstances) to rationally choose suicide, or by definition is anyone who's capable of it not in a position to think rationally on this issue? For a systematic exploration of this issue, try &lt;a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/death/phil-176" target="_blank"&gt;lectures 24–26 of Shelly Kagan's Open Course from Yale on Death &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the classic Hindu text from possibly around the 3rd century B.C.E., which is a part of the Indian Epic poem &lt;em &gt;Mahabharata &lt;/em &gt;, attributed to Vyasa, though that probably wasn't a single person.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is it to live wisely? What grounds duty? The text is a conversation on the eve of battle between the archer hero Arjuna and his charioteer, Krishna, who in the course of the text reveals himself to be the supreme God. Arjuna is considering whether it might in fact be immoral to engage in this battle in which he'd end up killing many of his relatives. Krishna assures him that first, killing someone doesn't kill what's really them, i.e. the atman (soul) that survives through multiple rebirths; second, that Arjuna is of the warrior caste, and it's his duty to fight; and third, because of determinism, it's like these people are already dead directly at the hands of Krishna. So fight on!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The &lt;em &gt;Bhagavad Gita &lt;/em &gt;was not always considered a central text of Indian philosophy, but became very popular in the early 20th century: Both &lt;a href="https://unpolishedjade.wordpress.com/2006/07/25/gandhi-on-violence-in-the-bhagavad-gita/" target="_blank"&gt;Gandhi &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/gita-gandhi-and-godse/article6835411.ece" target="_blank"&gt;Gandhi's assassin &lt;/a &gt;cited the text in support of their actions. It focuses less on what you should do exactly but instead, why you should do it. It represents a compromise between two opposing traditions: First, the early &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas" target="_blank"&gt;Vedas &lt;/a &gt;that just provided advice on how to best provide offerings to the various gods and generate good karma for a better rebirth, and second, the more philosophical take in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads" target="_blank"&gt;Upanishads &lt;/a &gt;that stressed that even good rebirths are still a drag and that you should instead realize the oneness of all (we are all Brahman) and transcend the cycle of rebirth altogether through an ascetic detachment from the fruits of action.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The &lt;em &gt;Gita &lt;/em &gt;affirms this "yoga of knowledge" ("yoga" just meaning "discipline," literally a yoking of yourself to something) by which one cultivates an identification with this unity, and also promotes the "yoga of action" to avoid the monkish asceticism of the Upanishads: You can and should act according to your duty (determined by your role in society), but if you do so for duty's sake, and not because you'll get some reward, then you'll avoid accruing karma (good or bad!). But still, this kind of super-Stoic/Kantian attitude is hard for people, especially those less philosophically sophisticated, so Krishna also offers the "yoga of devotion," whereby you keep acting, but make each of your actions a devotion to God. So this is sort of like the progression from Catholicism to Protestantism in the West: It's no longer about being tied into certain ritual traditions and authorities, and not necessarily about understanding and internalizing the philosophy, but more about your personal, direct relationship with the Divine.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But is there really room in a monistic metaphysics for a personal God? If God is really the whole of existence, why paint a smiley face on it that you should then relate to (as opposed to just &lt;em &gt;be &lt;/em &gt;)? We faced this issue before with Spinoza, who likewise held that strictly speaking, we are all One, but still had a lot of tolerance for (if not actual belief in) views of God as a personality. For Spinoza too, what's essential whatever your beliefs is a religious comportment, a commitment to duty, to loving your neighbor. Could one, though, be very much aware of his or her oneness with the universe and/or devoting one's every action to duty or God while still performing actions that are morally repellant, that are not "loving" on any reasonable definition?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We also discuss the metaphysics, which is very well explained by Keya Maitra in her &lt;em &gt;Philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita &lt;/em &gt;(2018), which is the translation that most of us used and includes chapter-by-chapter commentary that connects the text to themes in Western philosophy. The concepts of pakriti (nature) and perusha (self) are sort of like body and mind in the western tradition, but pakriti, interestingly, also includes character and other mental characteristics, specifically the three gunas, which are genetic and causal personality elements that we all have in various proportions according to this scheme: knowledge (goodness), passion, and dark inertia. So what's left to be perusha, or what is truly mind, under our manifest personality characteristics? Well, it's not something that's part of the causal matrix, but instead just a witness, a point of consciousness that is in fact, were we only to realize it, an aspect of the Supreme Perusha, which is Krishna himself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So there are all sorts of problematic details involved in this account which the text itself doesn't address, but which are discussed at great length in the many commentaries upon it (which we did not read). For instance, the "atman" (self) is supposed to be the soul that is consistent through various rebirths. This seems well positioned to be our personal piece of perusha, but what's the nature of the relationship between that atman and personality and physical body (and gunas) that are associated with it in a given lifetime? It's supposed to be an advantage of the pakriti/perusha distinction over the Cartesian body/mind distinction that we needn't worry about Cartesian interactionism (how does the soul steer the body?), but in thinking about atman vs. manifest personality, we seem to have a similar problem.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also, if the gunas determine our personality, which determines karmic acquisition, which then determines our next rebirth which in turn determines our gunas, then is there any sense in which we have free will, i.e. in which case it makes sense to strive for moral excellence as opposed to just letting your character determine your actions. All of this seems to take place on the level of pakriti. Either perusha (your real self) has no causal power, or there are "less pure" levels of perusha that really are entangled in the causal order, in which case we no longer have a hard-and-fast distinction between pakriti and perusha. Maybe this is just as well, since they're both ultimately reducible to Krisha, the one god-substance (called "Brahaman" in the earlier Vedic tradition). But we still have the overall problem of how an all-pervasive god-substance could have "aspects" at all, could have more pure and less pure aspects (higher and lower aspects) without some kind of non-god tainting substance in the mix. (See our Parmenides episode for more on the problems of envisaging a monist metaphysics.) Krishna also describes himself as the seed of excellence in everything; he provides a source of teleological motion (using Aristotle's terminology): for each thing to pursue its virtue is to move toward or in accordance with that part of our character.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Conveniently, our gunas are aligned with our caste: bad karma causes us to be born into a bad womb, i.e. a low social station and the gunas appropriate to that. So even though theoretically, someone of any caste can pursue the yoga of devotion, making this a very egalitarian theology, all those dark-inertia-gunas will as a practical matter make someone of lower caste unlikely to have the fortitude to successfully pursue any of the yogas. So this text has been accused of helping to cement the social hierarchy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you enjoy this discussion, try our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/10/10/ep27-nagarjuna-buddhism-citizens/" target="_blank"&gt;episode 27 &lt;/a &gt;on Buddhist metaphysics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks so much to &lt;a href="https://philosophy.unca.edu/faces/faculty/keya-maitra" target="_blank"&gt;Keya Matira &lt;/a &gt;for sending us copies of her new translation, which you should definitely purchase: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07931SZ53/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07931SZ53 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=2e7a600a5aa538663caec032ff2f067c" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita: A Contemporary Introduction &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;More on Julia Kristeva's &lt;em &gt;Powers of Horror &lt;/em &gt;(1980) plus H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu" (1928).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the object of fear? In our last episode, we outlined Kristeva's view that it's ultimately the disintegration of self. Our purpose in this further episode (featuring Mark, Seth, and Dylan, who couldn't attend last time) was to clarify her account of how self-integrity is accomplished and then to use Lovecraft's unnameable (OK, he's named Cthulhu) and undepictable (well, OK, the story has lots of depictions of him; he's even a plush doll) object of fear as a case study exploring how well Kristeva's notion of abjection captures what we understand fear to amount to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For the full Kristeva experience, listen to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-202-julia-on-22530963" target="_blank"&gt;PEL #202 &lt;/a &gt;and Mark's &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-202-follow-up-22640515" target="_blank"&gt;Close Reading &lt;/a &gt;before this, and then read along: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231053479/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0231053479 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=2487101409ce944c3b7d500508d23ace" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://users.clas.ufl.edu/burt/touchyfeelingsmaliciousobjects/Kristevapowersofhorrorabjection.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.

Note that there's nothing in there to indicate that "object" in the psychoanalytic sense is especially to connote an individuated thing as opposed to an undifferentiated mass. Since seeing Kristeva as talking about differentiation vs. unnameable is essential to my reading of the text right from page 1, then either Wes is wrong that Kristeva is solely participating in the psychoanalytic tradition here and not referring to the more ordinary, philosophical use of "object" as differentiated thing, or I'm just totally wrong here. Listen to Kristeva's words and see what you think!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection &lt;/em &gt;(1980), chapters 1 and 2.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is horror? Kristeva's book is about a process she calls "abjection," where we violently reject things like corpses, bodily wastes and other fluids, and the Lovecraftian unnameable that lurks at the edge of our awareness, hideously inhuman and indifferent to our suffering.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The book is also all about the self, suggesting modifications to Freud's Oedipal complex (in which we mature through the intervention of a father figure or civilization in general, breaking our bond with the mother) and Lacan's mirror-stage story (where we gain selfhood by contemplating a unified, external image of ourselves, which is also informed by language, or what Lacan calls the "Name of the Father").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Kristeva, becoming a separate person from your mother begins earlier than either of these points, before the mother or the self has been identified as a distinct entity. In Freud's account, the mother is our first object of desire, and it's only after we've identified her as such that the influence of the father (or whoever is playing that role; really, the point is that we realize that mother has desires other than just for us) comes in to break up the party and thus (hopefully) elicit our independent selfhood.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;For Kristeva, something parallel to this happens before any objects have been individuated at all. Imagine, she says, that you are a baby, and as far as you are concerned, you and your mother are one and the same creature. Your desires are her desires. But then she gives you some milk that has this skin on its surface, that's really pretty vile, so you spit it out. Well, this was a gift from the mother (from you!), a symbol of her desire (your desire!), yet you're rejecting it, and not just in a "no thanks, mom" way, but spitting it out, deeming it intolerable. Kristeva says that in doing so, you're splitting yourself in half. You're taking the part of you that was equivalent with mom and condemning it, while another part of you is the rejector, which is the first hint of an authentic, individual self here. Of course (as with the Oedipal complex), you still kind of love the mother-part, but you're denying it: denying that you love it, and denying that it's part of you.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kristeva sees this infant dynamic as playing throughout life, sometimes for healthy purposes, sometimes in pathological ways. That primal unity with the mother is something that we at once long for and dread. It stands for a time when we were not yet a person, not differentiated from the rest of nature. It's the flip side of erotic ecstasy, where we yearn for and occasionally achieve the semblance of unity with another person and/or God and/or the universe. In abjection, we're basically fighting for our lives as individuals against being swallowed up by the rest of existence.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Now, if you remember &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/04/03/ep74-lacan-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;your Lacan &lt;/a &gt;, you'll recall how language (the "Name of the Father") picks out individual things, yet leaves the vast, unnamed mass of the world out there as what he calls the "real." You've got the world of order established through language on the one hand, with a finite number of objects governed by definable scientific laws. This is the realm of civilization, in which we (try to) rest with comfort. But the Lacanian real—this vast unknown landscape underneath what reason can pick out—that's something that beckons to us with the idea that there are more things in heaven and earth than are contained in our philosophy. It pulls at us emotionally, but yet from the point of view of reason, it's intolerable; we'd rather deny it exists. So abjection is a drive: an undirected, ambivalent feeling. We can't quite pick out what we're so scared of but also attracted to, because our strong feelings push that "thing" outside of the realm of individuated things.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You may have heard about &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/viGgB44rxdU" target="_blank"&gt;Jordan Peterson describing femininity as the essence of chaos &lt;/a &gt;and the masculine as representing order. Well, that's a variation off of this psychoanalytic trope: It was our unity with the mother that amounted to our submersion in chaos, and it was the intercession of the father figure (language, civilization) that brought order into our lives.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;According to this view, misogyny is not a historical accident but is rooted in human nature, in this experience that we all (boys and girls alike) had in having to split from the mother. But it rests on a fundamental mistake: We're really, in the experience of abjection, trying to cut off a piece of ourselves, which of course you can never really do, so it's always going to be out there, denied, nagging at you.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When we see a corpse, we viscerally feel our own mortality: We see ourselves in that corpse, imagine ourselves dead, which is of course to imagine ourselves as nothingness, which is very distressing. Bodily fluids and such also represent this part of us (or someone like us) that we're casting off. The whole horror genre, whether of the slasher, corpse-displaying variety or the Lovecraftian-unnamed-dread variety, is predicated on our being simultaneously attracted and repelled by this "beyond" that we have pushed out of consciousness. When someone acts purposefully perversely, they're comparably violating the moral order, so our disgust at that can produce the feeling of abjection too.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kristeva sees abjection as manifest in both religion and art. Many religions enact strict purity requirements, attempting to permanently block off the abjected world from worshippers both physically and mentally. Many adventurous types of art, on the other hand, play with the breakdown of language into mere noise (think James Joyce), or allow us to flirt with the fantastical, unknown, and/or perverse. Even the act of writing itself, with its pretense at immortality (my words remain even if I die), allows one to safely explore these borders to ordered existence, perhaps providing a way of channeling this inevitable fascination as an alternative to self-tyranny or lashing out.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though Kristeva herself doesn't draw this comparison, commentators also use the notion of abjection to elucidate anti-immigrant and other xenophobic sentiment: pretty much any time you're asserting your identity as a member of a known, supposedly rational in-group as against a sea of barbarians, then there's a similar logic going on to what happens in abjection.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Seth are joined by Kristeva fan and education/linguistics grad student Kelley Citrin to try to make sense of this text, which is dense and difficult but still fun and resonant.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231053479/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0231053479 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=2487101409ce944c3b7d500508d23ace" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://users.clas.ufl.edu/burt/touchyfeelingsmaliciousobjects/Kristevapowersofhorrorabjection.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark felt challenged enough by this text to feel compelled to record a &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/22640515"&gt;Close Reading &lt;/a &gt;of p. 1–4 as a follow-up to this discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We (well, Mark, Seth, and Dylan, who had done the reading but ended up not being able to make this recording) then continue discussing this text for ep. 203, partially in an attempt to relate this more to horror, using H.P.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Seth continue the discussion on &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-201-marcus-22279068"&gt;#201 &lt;/a &gt;to get further into the specifics of Marcus's metaphysics and how this is supposed to relate to behavior. Can his directives really come solely "from reason," as he claims? How does this interact with the behaviors that we pursue (appropriately, according to Marcus) "by nature," i.e., without conscious deliberation required? Seth is concerned with how individualistic the philosophy is. Mark is concerned that if you discard the metaphysics (as modern skeptics largely do), why should you expect the rest of the philosophy to be coherent?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations" target="_blank"&gt;The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(ca. 180 CE) plus Ryan's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735211736/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0735211736 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=d7510ef0d047330a853335931f9799d3" target="_blank"&gt;The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2016), which was co-written with Stephen Hanselman and features original translations and interpretations of passages from Marcus, Seneca, Epictetus, and others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What does Stoicism look like in practice, in both ancient and modern contexts? You might think that eschewing the shallow, out-of-our-control trappings of fame and wealth in favor of personal cultivation would make one unambitious, but Ryan uses Marcus as a prime example of how to be a Stoic while trying to accomplish great things.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Unlike his key influence Epictetus, Marcus did not need Stoicism to exert his freedom while being a slave, though arguably Marcus's position as Roman emperor (which he did not choose) placed burdens on him akin to slavery. Marcus's concern was to keep his cool and not let his power corrupt him while enacting his duties, and he wrote the &lt;em &gt;Meditations &lt;/em &gt;as a philosophical journal for his own benefit, though he usually wrote with care, using his best literary chops. Very little in the &lt;em &gt;Meditations &lt;/em &gt;is (or claimed to be) original, so the value of the text is in its providing an exemplar on how to live the Stoic tradition, which is very inspirational to modern Stoics like Ryan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan all engage Ryan in a very contemporary debate: Given what we've learned about psychology over the last 2000 years, does this method of basically repeating wise sayings to yourself over and over actually hold up? Is it desirable or possible to essentially overwrite our instincts with Stoic ideas about proper mental comportment? Marcus has very specific ideas about nature and our place within it that would seem very archaic to most of us; does that undermine his viability as a model? Many modern Stoics advocate a &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/08/30/mind-games-and-word-games-practical-philosophers-give-philosophy-a-chance/" target="_blank"&gt;pick-and-choose philosophy &lt;/a &gt;that tends to ignore issues like the metaphysical grounding for Stoicism in favor of merely figuring out what works for you. Whereas Marcus took our duty and purpose as a given, and our job as to function properly in that role, Ryan offers more of an "existential Stoicism," where you choose or figure out what you want to make of your life, and then use Stoicism to do that as effectively as possible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is our third try to get a handle on Stoicism; listeners may find it valuable to start with our earlier episodes on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/09/21/ep124-1-epictetus/" target="_blank"&gt;Epictetus &lt;/a &gt;and then &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/01/25/ep132-1-seneca/" target="_blank"&gt;Seneca &lt;/a &gt;. Given the topical and wide-ranging character of this discussion, Seth and I felt we could do more in laying out material directly from the text, and did so in a Citizen-only follow-up discussion to be released within the next week.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://seinfeld.co/library/meditations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the Gregory Hays translation of the &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://seinfeld.co/library/meditations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Meditations &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://seinfeld.co/library/meditations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812968255/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0812968255 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a771877c01dfc6c277dc015baab970a3" target="_blank"&gt;buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On "What Is Enlightenment" by Immanuel Kant (1784), "On Enlightening the Mind" by Moses Mendelssohn (1784), and "What Is Enlightenment" by Michael Foucault (1984).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/pel-live/" target="_blank"&gt;Participate in the survey to help us plan our 10 year anniversary PEL Live event!&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;At the end of the historical period known as the Enlightenment, a Berlin newspaper asked what exactly that is, and Kant and Mendelssohn both responded (neither having read the other's answer). According to Kant, it's all about being able to think for yourself, apart from any authority telling you what to believe. However, he distinguished what he called the public use of reason, which is what the international scholarly community engages in and which Kant thought should be unrestricted, from the professional (he calls it "private," counter-intuitively for us) use of reason, e.g., in carrying out your job duties. The latter (perhaps seeking to appease his monarch Frederick II) Kant said could legitimately be curtailed to prevent public unrest. &lt;a href="http://uwch-4.humanities.washington.edu/Texts/KANT/CAMBRIDGE-EDITION/enlightenment.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Kant's essay online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141043881/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0141043881 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=b8507242dfe60a152260c3d28e34d46e" target="_blank"&gt;buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mendelssohn distinguished between enlightenment, which has to do with theory (philosophy), and cultivation, which has to do with practice (both scientific and in terms of the arts, manners, morals). He was concerned that these two be balanced: Too much cultivation with not enough enlightenment (he pointed to Confucian China as an example, with its strict conformism) stifles us as individuals, but too much enlightenment with not enough cultivation leads to breakdown of public order. So elites may be justified in lying to people so that there's popular acceptance of calming truths (e.g., that leaders know what they're doing, that there's a moral and religious order that they should obey), even though this is not maximally nourishing to people's individual minds. &lt;a href="https://persistentenlightenment.com/2014/03/18/moses-mendelssohn-on-enlightening-the-mind/" target="_blank"&gt;Read Mendelssohn's essay online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Foucault's essay is an analysis of and response to Kant's. Foucault recommends a historical/genealogical approach to understanding the modernity brought about by the Enlightenment. Enlightenment does not lead to an escape from historical contingency as Kant may have thought; we do not magically rise above the ideology of our particular society and attain true independence of thought. Rather, it's an ongoing process of criticism, of practical investigation of our own limits, and one of its concerns (comparable to Mendelssohn's concern with over-civilization) is that the technologies of control may outpace the self-awareness that allows a society to keep these in check. &lt;a href="https://leap.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2017/01/Foucault-What-is-enlightenment.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read Foucault's essay online &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;An article that was helpful to us in providing background re. the intellectual climate in 1784 that gave rise to this debate was "Kant, Mendelssohn, and the Question of Enlightenment" (1989) by James Schmidt. &lt;a href="https://open.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/2413/schmidt_question.pdf?sequence=3" target="_blank"&gt;Read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Holy Fool" by Love and Rockets.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;The U. of Michigan prof joins us to discuss &lt;em &gt;Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (and Why We Don't Talk about It)&lt;/em &gt;(2017) and “What Is the Point of Equality?” (1999). This is really an episode and a half: a full discussion with Liz, then additional talk about the texts (mostly the 1999 article) among your four hosts Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is government? Liz points to the historical use of the term to refer to not just the state, but any organized power relations, including the relation between a firm and its employees. What is it for something to be private? The term is relative, meaning that something is not private in itself but private with regard to some people: it's not their concern. A state can be a public government if it's nominally responsive to the concerns of the people, i.e., if it's representative. A tyranny would be a private government.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;With these terms in place, Liz wants to describe companies as private governments, and hence we should use the scholarship of political science to evaluate them and try to make them more just, more accountable to the people whose lives they affect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The employer-employee relationship is defined by law as by default "at will" employment. The workers have no right to determine anything what they do within the workplace or how they do it, and even outside of work hours, employers can restrict employee speech or other activities, even if these restrictions don't have a work-related rationale.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The book is thus a critique of the libertarian ethos driving contemporary political discussions that resents government power but fails to recognize that most of us are living under private dictatorships, that our employers have a much greater day-to-day influence over our lives than the state, and we should be just as defensive of our autonomy against that type of power.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We think of employment relations as voluntary due to the right of exit (you can always quit), but our relationship to our employers is very different from our relationship to a vendor we shop from. Since virtually all employers are private dictatorships (and Liz includes working within a government agency within this description), the chance to choose among these hardly constitutes freedom. And realistically, for most workers, the power imbalance is such that the worst that a worker can do (quit), is more of a hardship for the worker than for the employer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The book goes into historical depth about Adam Smith, Thomas Paine and others who were champions of economic liberty and saw this as liberating in what we would now consider a "leftist" manner. Smith, for instance, thought that breaking up the guild system and getting rid of tariffs and other barriers to economic activity would result in nearly everyone being his or her own boss. He just didn't know about the impending industrial revolution and how that would drive economic power to centralize in large firms. Smith argued for universal public education, and Paine argued for a universal social insurance.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Liz stresses that this book is about the philosophical task of uncovering the concepts involved here and why our current ideology makes us blind to both problems and solutions. She is not herself making concrete policy proposals. But still, you can see in a general way what sort of solutions are possible here: More representation of workers' interests within company decision-making, a change in the legislation that currently establishes the relationship as "at will" by default (i.e., this is not a matter of government intervention in a heretofore private relationship; the relationship is already constituted by law, and Liz just wants that law to improve), removing health care from the responsibility of employers through a public program, potentially other measures to increase the feasibility of exit from a bad employment situation for low-skilled workers like a universal basic income, and measures such as campaign finance reform to keep the rich from exerting undue political power and so corrupting public decision-making in their favor.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Liz claims that the argument (represented within Liz's book itself by a response essay by economist &lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/tyler-cowen-on-stubborn-attachments-prosperity-and-the-good-society/" target="_blank"&gt;Tyler Cowen &lt;/a &gt;) that moving power in these ways more into the hands of workers will doom economic growth and hence be bad for utilitarian reasons over the long term, is simply not supported by empirical evidence. You can hear Liz being grilled by libertarian-leaning economist Russ Roberts in &lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/elizabeth-anderson-on-worker-rights-and-private-government/" target="_blank"&gt;this episode of EconTalk &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The 1999 paper provides much of the philosophical grounding for the newer book. There Liz argues for a conception of equality that is not dependent on correcting for the vagaries of fortune (that way lies &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/09/06/ct1-harrison-bergeron/" target="_blank"&gt;Harrison Bergeron &lt;/a &gt;!) to make sure that goods or even opportunities are evenly distributed. Rather, human dignity requires that each person be granted a certain level of inalienable autonomy, representation, and ultimately, status. Even work requiring little skill is valuable to this cooperative enterprise we call the economy. Every person needs to be ensured goods requisite to a minimum level of flourishing, and laziness, poor choices, or even criminal behavior doesn't negate one's right to this minimum (the exact level can vary according to the overall wealth of the society). Economic inequality is fine, but cannot be allowed to result in power relations that undermine this requirement.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There is still plenty of room left for advancement above this minimum to fully motivate economic activity. Liz doesn't think that we have the responsibility to support beyond the minimum the flourishing of "beach bums." Rather, each of us has a moral responsibility to contribute to the cooperative human project. We discuss to what degree Liz's views violate &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/12/07/episode-85-rawls-on-social-justice/" target="_blank"&gt;Rawlsian &lt;/a &gt;neutrality regarding conceptions of the good (i.e., society according to classical liberalism is supposed to remain neutral re. what the good life amounts to and let citizens live according to their different opinions about this) and whether this should worry us.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691176515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691176515 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=1c435dea6d05347550fbd5f0cc8df007" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.philosophy.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/4ElizabethAnderson.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read "What Is the Point of Equality" online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Seth continue our conversation from ep. 198 by going through the arguments in the second half of the dialogue.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This puzzling section is largely a monologue by the character Parmenides, with the stated aim of showing the implications from first, the assumption that the One exists, and then that the One does not exist. But is this really the One that Parmenides speaks of in his Way of Truth (see ep. 197), or is this the Platonic Form of One, i.e., unity or countability? The exercise seems to assume that these are the same thing. The exercise is presented to show young Socrates how to do philosophy thoroughly, but does Plato actually think this is the right method? After all, here's its final conclusion:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;blockquote &gt;&lt;p &gt;Let this be said therefore, and that, as it appears, if The One is or isn't, it and the others in relation to themselves and in relation to each other are all things in all ways and are not, and seem and seem not.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/blockquote &gt;&lt;p &gt;So clearly something has gone wrong here, but Plato doesn't give us a clue exactly what. Join us to talk through some of the specific arguments that result in this conclusion and the interpretations that scholars have put on it. Surrender to the madness!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the most peculiar Platonic dialogue, from ca. 350 BCE.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are properties real things in the world, or just in the mind? Plato famously thought that for a property like "large," there's a Form that causes all the large things to be large, and which enables us to recognize those things as large. These Forms are not material things, and hence aren't the objects of ordinary sensation. In other dialogues like "&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/07/11/ep40-plato-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;The &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/07/11/ep40-plato-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/07/11/ep40-plato-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Republic &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;," we get a picture of Forms as being in a true, heavenly realm, known explicitly only to the enlightened and perhaps to all of us before we were born.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In this dialogue, Plato provides critiques of his own theory, as an aged Parmenides confronts a youthful Socrates. What exactly is the relationship between Forms and the particulars that have the properties? If the Form is broken up so that a bit of Large is in every large thing, then wouldn't those pieces of Large be (relatively) small? If on the other hand every large thing has the whole of the Form of Large in it, then how can the Form be in multiple places at once? Even if the Form is sort of draped over all the things, it would only be one part of the Form that touches any given thing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Then there's the famous "third man" argument: We're supposed to recognize that large things are large because they all resemble the Form of Large. But then how do we recognize that the particular large thing and the Form Large are both Large? There must be a second Form that we consult to make this comparison, and a third Form that we use to compare the second Form with the first one, &lt;em &gt;ad &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;infinitum &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The most worrying objection, according to the character Parmenides, is that if Forms are so perfect and otherworldly, how could we with our human minds know anything about them? How could they even be in causal connection with material things?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;These are all objections that Plato has Parmenides put forward, and Socrates, being young and inexperienced, admits he has no good defense. So is Plato abandoning his own theory? Or maybe just presenting some challenges that one has to overcome to refine it?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second half of the dialogue (which we don't discuss much here, though Mark and Seth get into it in a follow-up episode to be posted for Citizens this week), Parmenides gives a long analysis of what results if we assume either that The One does exist or if it doesn't. Either way, absurdities result. So perhaps Plato is trying to argue that while the theory of Forms has problems, Parmenides's monist solution (described in &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/08/20/ep197-parmenides-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our last episode &lt;/a &gt;) is even worse. Or maybe saying that you have to change the theory of Forms in some way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://ia800200.us.archive.org/4/items/dialoguesplatov00platgoog/dialoguesplatov00platgoog.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;This is the electronic version &lt;/a &gt;(translated by Jowett) that we had on hand as we spoke.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes discusses Steven Spielberg's &lt;em &gt;AI: Artificial Intelligence &lt;/em &gt;with &lt;a href="http://staff.kings.edu/davidjohnson/" target="_blank"&gt;David Kyle Johnson &lt;/a &gt;, philosophy professor at King’s College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. You’ll find his &lt;em &gt;Great Courses &lt;/em &gt;lectures &lt;a href="https://www.thegreatcourses.com/professors/david-k-johnson/" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, including a course on &lt;a href="https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/sci-phi-science-fiction-as-philosophy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Science Fiction as Philosophy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Philosophers are wont to talk about artificial intelligence in terms of &lt;em &gt;thinking &lt;/em &gt;and the cognitive functions that comprise or support it: perception, representation, the use of language, reasoning, and so on.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what about feelings? In the popular imagination, robots—even humanoid robots that are nearly exact replicas of human beings (think of Data from &lt;em &gt;Star Trek &lt;/em &gt;)—often seem to be lacking in or devoid of affect. The stereotypical robot voice—the one we use to imitate a robot—is meant to convey the stilted and unemotional. To this way of thinking, the intelligence of intelligent robots is too ... robotic. It is naturally a parody of our humanity. We seem both to fear and hope that artificial intelligence in its fullest sense—one that truly captures human consciousness—is prone to failure. Let’s call this &lt;em &gt;the problem of artificial affect &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The problem of artificial affect—and the consequent artificiality of artificial intelligence—is made especially urgent in Spielberg’s &lt;em &gt;AI: Artificial Intelligence &lt;/em &gt;. The film is set in future in which anti-robot pogroms—Flesh Fairs, as they are called—are a threat to the survival of an especially vulnerable protagonist: a new sort of humanoid, a little boy with the capacity to love. His heartbreaking quest to become “real” so that he can win back the love of his abandoning adoptive mother helps us explore the question of what it means to be fully human. And answering the question of why Flesh Fair bear such hatred for humanoids—“mechas,” as they are called—sheds some light on this question, as it does toward our own dehumanizing tendencies.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is there to fear, in artificial intelligence? Is there something repugnantly dishonest about it—is it a failed representation of humanity? Will its artificiality contaminate us? Or is the ability to lie—the robotic failure to fully engage in the lie that is social conformity—the thing we fear most? And what of the fact that the film’s humanoids are all essentially still items of use, servants, substitutes, and prostitutes: designed to meet our emotional needs, and yet unable to fully make their own demands on our capacities for love and recognition? Finally, what does it mean to be fully real? How do we know if we’re fully real? And if not, how do we become fully real?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss these questions and more in Episode 3 of &lt;strong &gt;&lt;em &gt;(sub)Text &lt;/em &gt;&lt;/strong &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the fragments referred to as "On Nature" from ca. 475 BCE, featuring guest Peter Adamson from the &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/" target="_blank"&gt;History of Philosophy without Any Gaps podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One of the most influential Presocratic philosophers, Parmenides gives "the Way of Truth," which is that there is only Being, and talking of Non-Being is nonsense. And guess what? Any talk of difference implies non-being, so that's right out too, which means all of what we perceive must be an illusion: There is only a singular Being that is everything, which, peculiarly, Parmenides tells us is a finite sphere.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As a way of explaining the appearance, Parmenides also provides us with (in fragments; a lot of this has been lost) "the Way of Seeming," which is a two-element cosmology that he thinks can compete with those of the other Presocratic physicists, you know, if you want to stray from the actual truth and play their game. So there's the question of why P. felt the need to write this, how exactly it relates to his Truth account, and what the role of myth is in setting up the story: It's a goddess who's showing the narrator these "Ways" after he has been flown to an esoteric realm on a magic chariot, which is of course what you'd expect from the guy who's been credited with inventing logic and metaphysics!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Listeners may want to listen to &lt;a href="https://historyofphilosophy.net/parmenides" target="_blank"&gt;Peter's short introduction to the text from his podcast &lt;/a &gt;and also &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/07/11/ep143-1-plato-sophist/" target="_blank"&gt;our previous discussion on Plato's "Sophist"&lt;/a &gt;that purports to solve the Parmenidean problem of how to talk about non-being.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We recommend the Kirk/Raven/Schofield volume &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521274559/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0521274559 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=1a7ef920848c6e96686f6159de70b275" target="_blank"&gt;The Presocratic Philosophers: A Critical History with a Selection of Texts &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Parmenides" target="_blank"&gt;Here's an online version of the text &lt;/a &gt;(not the same translation).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Among the secondary sources that most of us already looked at are the Parmenides chapter (p. 113) by David Sedley in &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://uwch-4.humanities.washington.edu/Texts/JOSH-H/Philosophy%20Guides,%20Analysis'%20and%20Resources%20(ver.2)/Cambridge/The%20Cambridge%20Companion%20to%20Early%20Greek%20Philosophy%20(Cambridge%20Companions%20to%20Philosophy).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;and &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides/" target="_blank"&gt;John Palmer's entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www2.phil.cam.ac.uk/~swb24/" target="_blank"&gt;The Cambridge/etc. prof &lt;/a &gt;best known for his neo-Humean meta-ethics joins Mark, Wes, and Dylan to discuss his book &lt;em &gt;On Truth &lt;/em &gt;(2018).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is truth? A pragmatist like William James wants to &lt;em &gt;define &lt;/em &gt;truth in terms of the procedures we actually undergo to confirm a claim. Simon instead buys into a &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/07/22/ep195-austin-strawson-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;performative &lt;/a &gt;/deflationist view of truth. The notion can't be defined in general, but we can describe how it works in a specific domain, like how we judge the truth of scientific claims is different than for ethical or aesthetic claims. Still, none of those domains are going to be "just a matter of opinion." We acknowledge that some people are qualified to make judgments in a particular area through their acumen and expertise with relevant procedures, and those are the people (and procedures) that we regard as reliable sources of truth, even though we're not &lt;em &gt;defining &lt;/em &gt;truth as whatever it is they determine.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is the payoff for &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/07/08/ep194-tarski-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;two episodes &lt;/a &gt;of threshing through the jungles of analytic philosophy, as Simon's book leads us systematically through the correspondence, coherence, pragmatist, and deflationist theories of truth. Then in the second half (both of his book and our discussion) we focus on those domain-specific procedures, making connections to Hume, Kant, Peirce, Collingwood (a new one to us), and others.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0190867213/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0190867213 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=58f46640cc8867eb9339c0e1353d30fc" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book!&lt;/a &gt;And his previous book, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195315804/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195315804 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=68e71cfe87adc3c2a070e3b6242052f4" target="_blank"&gt;Truth: A Guide for the Perplexed &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(2005), is even more beefy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "with you/for you" from the new &lt;em &gt;cold/mess &lt;/em &gt;EP by Prateek Kuhad, interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem79-prateek-kuhad/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #79 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On two articles in the "ordinary language" tradition of philosophy called "Truth" from 1950 by J.L. Austin and P.F. Strawson.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You may remember John Langshaw Austin as the &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/03/18/ep186-austin-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;performatives guy &lt;/a &gt;, but it's actually &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/05/02/ep93-strawson-free-will/" target="_blank"&gt;Peter Frederick Strawson &lt;/a &gt;(whom &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/05/02/ep93-strawson-free-will/" target="_blank"&gt;we covered &lt;/a &gt;in the context of free will) who (shortly before either of these papers) came up with what has become known as the performative theory of truth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is a breed of what we've called the deflationary theory of truth: the idea that "is true" doesn't actually add any cognitive content to a sentence ("It is raining," vs. "It is true that it is raining," tell you the same thing). The "performance" here is the idea that adding "is true" is a signal in a conversation that you agree with something, that you're willing to assert it, that you believe it. So it serves a role in a language game, and in that way in using the term you mean something over and beyond just stating the sentence itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Austin responded to Strawson's idea in outlining his theory of truth in his paper for the 1950 &lt;em &gt;Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society &lt;/em &gt;. According to traditional views, truth is a property of sentences or propositions, whereas on any deflationary view, truth is not going to be a property at all. Austin says that Strawson was right in saying that truth is not a property of sentences, but denies that it's not a property. On the contrary, says Austin, it is a property of utterances, i.e., statements made at a particular time by a particular person. Every such utterance involves two sets of conventions: descriptive conventions that correlate the words used with types of situations and things that are found in the world (for "It is raining," this would include an understanding of what "rain" in general refers to), and demonstrative conventions ("demonstrative" just means something like pointing at something) that correlate the words with historic situations in the world (what is referred to in the particular situation of saying "It is raining," by "It," i.e. the environment as determined by the context of the utterance). When the state of affairs pointed out (demonstrative conventions) is "of a type with" the what is being described (descriptive conventions), then the utterance is true.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Strawson paper that we read (written for the same society meeting) responds to Austin: Strawson thinks that this idea that it's the utterance that's true or false is wrong: Clearly, it's not a particular speech act that is true or not, but &lt;em &gt;what is said &lt;/em &gt;in that speech act that's true or not, and of course you and I can say the same thing at different times. Now, note that this may be a misinterpretation of Austin, because Austin himself says that of course you and I can make the same statement; his point is that the truth conditions of the statement are determined by the situation of a particular speaker. You and I can both say "It is raining," and mean different things. This was the whole reason that the idea of a "proposition" was invented distinct from particular utterances or sentences: because the same meaning can be conveyed using different words, by different speakers at different times, using different demonstrative conventions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So it may not be the case that Austin and Strawson actually disagree on this point, but Austin is stressing the fact that meaning is set not in the abstract but by a particular performance. Per his ideas about performatives (and he didn't give those lectures that we talked about until five years after this), being a performative doesn't mean that a speech act doesn't &lt;em &gt;also &lt;/em &gt;have a true/false dimension; it just gives you other dimensions to talk about a sentence, and Austin thinks that we very much overemphasize "true" and "false" as opposed to "exaggerated" or "vague" or "misleading" or "too concise." These are all ways, according to Austin, that a sentence can serve or fail to serve desired functions.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Strawson does not think that those other words are in the same class as "true" and "false." The latter are more fundamental, he says, and don't require as sophisticated a language. However, Strawson's main objection to Austin is that he thinks Austin is not deflationist enough: Austin has given a "purified" correspondence theory, but it's still a correspondence theory, and that's bad.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;First, how is Austin's theory "purified?" Well, for early Wittgenstein, for instance, a proposition was true if it had an isomorphism with something in the world. "The ball is green" is true if there's a ball in the world, and it's coupled with the color green. By stressing conventions, Austin wants to point out that there's no rule that says that language always has to express facts in this structurally transparent way. "It is raining" doesn't connect a particular "it" to rain, for instance, or you could have a whole language where single words pick out complex situations (my example on the podcast is "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_slang_terms#FUBAR" target="_blank"&gt;Fubar &lt;/a &gt;!").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Second, what's wrong with correspondence theory? On the traditional picture (or on Austin's), you've got a sentence (or utterance, or proposition), and it corresponds with something in the world. But what are these "things" to which it corresponds? "The ball is green" doesn't correspond with the thing that is the ball; that doesn't sound quite right. It corresponds with "the ball being green," i.e., with the fact that the ball is green, or perhaps you'd prefer to say (as Wittgenstein does) the state of affairs of the ball being green.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But what is a fact? Is a fact a thing? Is it in the world? No, when you look around, you see things like balls, you see green, but nowhere do you see a fact. "Fact," according to Strawson, is a term that already crosses the mind-world divide. There are no facts in the world, and saying that a statement corresponds with a fact doesn't actually tell you anything; it's just another way of saying that the statement is true. Now, Austin doesn't like "fact," either and instead goes with "state of affairs," but Strawson says that doesn't help; a state of affairs is just a collection of facts, so that term also has mind baked into it already.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Strawson claims that the question "What is it for a statement to correspond to a fact?" is similar to "what is it for a command to be obeyed?" If you already understand what a command is, then you already understand what obeying is because they're part of the same vocabulary set. Likewise, if you already know what a statement is, then you already know what it is for a statement to be true.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This should very much remind people of &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/07/08/ep194-tarski-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Davidson's and Field's criticisms of Tarski &lt;/a &gt;: Why would you think that you can define truth (a semantic notion) by nonsemantic notions (e.g., things in the physical world)? We can only understand terms within the same vocabulary domain in terms of their relations to each other.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Austin admits that if you admit "It is raining," you also admit "It is true that it is raining," but that doesn't change the fact that these sentences mean different things. By comparison, if someone commits a crime and I state that fact, and I'm accused of slander, well, yes, according to our laws (that entail that slander must be false), if we prove you committed the crime, then we prove that I didn't slander you. However, there could still be different trials to resolve these two issues; the slander and the truth of the crime are not one and the same thing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Both articles plus those for the previous episode can be found in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198752504/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198752504 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=80af89d85b3e900b7e561854178a7ec7" target="_blank"&gt;Truth (Oxford Readings in Philosophy)&lt;/a &gt;, edited by Simon Blackburn (guest for ep. 196) and Keith Simmons, or you can read them online &lt;a href="https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/pdf/austin.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/pdf/strawson.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Troof" by Shawn Phillips, as interviewed for &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem77-shawn-phillips/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #77.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Austin image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Tarski's “&lt;a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~francisp/Phil426/TarskiTruth1944.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Semantic Conception of Truth and the Foundations of Semantics &lt;/a &gt;,” (1944), Hartry Field's “&lt;a href="http://www.thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Readings/Field%20-%20Tarski's%20Theory.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Tarski's Theory of Truth &lt;/a &gt;” (1972), and Donald Davidson's“&lt;a href="http://www.filosofia.unimi.it/zucchi/NuoviFile/Davidson96.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Folly of Trying to Define Truth &lt;/a &gt;” (1977).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is truth? Tarski gives a technical, metaphysically neutral definition for truth within a particular, well-defined language. In short, a sentence is true if it is "satisfied" by all terms in the language. A sentence with a variable would be satisfied only by certain terms: "x is red" is satisfied only by the red ones. But a sentence &lt;em &gt;without &lt;/em &gt;a variable, if true, is satisfied by all terms: "Rose (a) is red," where (a) is a particular rose, is satisfied by that rose, because it's red, but it's also technically satisfied by my dog, by you, by Trump, etc., because none of those things interferes with the sentence being true. He had some lengthy proofs and logical language to establish this, and yes, this is weird.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One of his main reasons for doing this was to rule out things like the liar's paradox: e.g., "This sentence is false." On Tarski's analysis, a well-defined language doesn't allow this kind of sentence. As with &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/05/25/ep38-russell-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Russell's &lt;/a &gt;analysis of the paradoxical "sets that aren't members of themselves," Tarski distinguishes a language from its meta-language: When you say "'Snow is white' is true," you're taking a sentence in the language (snow is white) and by putting it in quotes, you're making it an object and saying something about it, using a different language, the meta-language, which includes all the terms of the object language, but also semantic terms like "is true." Tarski's truth definition is only about an object language (which cannot include any self-reflexive terms of this sort), but is stated in a meta-language. To make this clearer, some explanations actually use different languages, e.g., "'Schnee ist weiss' is true if and only if snow is white." German here is the object language, while English is the meta-language. (But of course, as I said, everyday German couldn't really be an object language, as it's not well-formed in the required way. There would have to be no room for misunderstanding.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Tarski claimed to be capturing our everyday notion of truth and making it more precise, with the idea that this could be extended from the formal, logical languages he was dealing with to at least formalized vocabularies within the sciences. He shunned many traditional philosophical questions, and so didn't talk much about what, if any, philosophical implications his theory provided.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Field charges Tarski with misunderstanding his own project. He says that Tarski was, like many of his peers in the era of behaviorism, wary of semantic notions, i.e., he wanted to reduce talk of mind to talk of matter.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To explain: The definition I've given above applies to just one single sentence. The definition of truth for the whole language is just the collection of true sentences so defined. This is an "extensional" definition, kind of like defining "sheep" not by giving essential characteristics of a sheep, but by pointing to the whole collection of sheep. Of course, if a new animal comes along, this leaves you unable to tell if it's a sheep or not. So it's not a definition as you'd normally consider it. And Tarski's definition only then is talking about actual sentences in a particular language, and isn't giving a general definition for truth for all languages. This would require, e.g., the semantic notion of synonymy (meaning), which (on Field's analysis) is an off-limits for Tarski.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Anyway, does just pointing to a bunch of (ultimately physical) objects and saying "those are the true ones" perform the reduction that Field says Tarski is trying to accomplish? No, because (Field says) there's still the semantic notion of reference smuggled into Tarski's procedure. We can better interpret what Tarski is doing by saying that he's defining truth in terms of other semantic notions, i.e., reference, definition, and satisfaction, which Field still thinks is helpful.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Davidson's paper gives a similar analysis of Tarski: Why would you think that you can define a basic notion like "truth" in terms of more basic notions? That's not really what philosophy does. Instead, we clarify the relations between fundamental terms; we adopt the whole conceptual apparatus of truth, reference, satisfaction, etc. as a group. Each can be understood in terms of the others, but the whole group of them can only be understood as a practice. No general definition is possible.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is the first of three episodes we'll be having on truth, and a recurrent theme that comes up that you may want to read about is the "deflationary theory of truth"; see the &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/#Def" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford article &lt;/a &gt;on it. The idea is that instead of saying that truth is explained by metaphysics (the correspondence of a sentence to something in the world) or by the coherence of our web of beliefs (as is the case for William James; you may want to re-listen to &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/07/18/ep22-james-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our discussion of him &lt;/a &gt;), truth is a very uninformative notion, indicating only that you're assenting to the sentence. According to &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/03/13/ep34-frege-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Frege &lt;/a &gt;, "P" and "'P' is true" say &lt;em &gt;exactly &lt;/em &gt;the same thing. Tarski doesn't want to make exactly that move, lest the liar's paradox persist, but he's in the same ballpark, and the notion of what counts as a deflationary theory has changed over time, from Frege's "eliminative" or "disquotational" theory—-i.e., you remove the quotation marks and "is true" and the sentences says the same thing—-to something more subtle.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;All three of these essays and the ones for next episode can be found in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198752504/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198752504 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=80af89d85b3e900b7e561854178a7ec7" target="_blank"&gt;Truth (Oxford Readings in Philosophy)&lt;/a &gt;, edited by Simon Blackburn (guest for ep. 196) and Keith Simmons.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "In Vino Vertias" by Sunspot; Mark interviewed Mike Huberty on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem64-mike-huberty-sunspot/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #64 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dylan returns to St. John's College, Annapolis to bring its president into dialogue with the PEL clan about Jacob Klein's “&lt;a href="http://www.hagiasophiaclassical.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jacob-Klein-The-Idea-of-Liberal-Education.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Idea of a Liberal Education &lt;/a &gt;” (1960) and “&lt;a href="http://www.hagiasophiaclassical.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/On-Liberal-Education-Jacob-Klein.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;On Liberal Education &lt;/a &gt;” (1965), plus Sidney Hook’s “&lt;a href="http://www.ditext.com/hook/hook.html" target="_blank"&gt;A Critical Appraisal of the St. John’s College Curriculum &lt;/a &gt;” (1946) and Martha Nussbaum’s “&lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1987/11/05/undemocratic-vistas/" target="_blank"&gt;Undemocratic Vistas &lt;/a &gt;” (1987).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Ep. 192 got us talking about a great-books-oriented education, and this discussion tackles that issue head-on: What constitutes a liberal education? Klein (a former Dean of St. John's) describes the process of &lt;em &gt;metastrophe &lt;/em &gt;(fundamental change), where you take the familiar and make it strange; you contemplate what you used to take for granted. Seeing thinkers of the past grapple with the concepts ancestral to the ones we use now, whether in the areas of science or politics or whatever, makes us question these current concepts and ultimately understand them better. Klein even has a story about how metastrophic questioning was necessary for these modern disciplines to be founded in the first place.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hook witnessed the first generation of Johnnies and was very critical of this idea of the same menu of ideas for all students, with a heavy emphasis on the history of science (rather than current, practical science) and learning ancient languages (as an exercise in translation and seeing how alien different languages are, not to be able to actually speak to anyone). He thought that study of the past should be guided by the concerns of the present, not insulated from them. What sense does it make for a student to know more about the political structure of ancient Greece than that of his or her own country?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nussbaum's article is a &lt;em &gt;New York Review of Books &lt;/em &gt;article about Bloom's book. She stresses contra Bloom that a philosophical education is practical, and that it should be made available to everyone. The SJC curriculum was (as Hook describes) originally advertised as the model that all colleges should follow, but time (and/or realism) has seemingly dampened that ambition. So, is there a single history of the intellectual life of the West that we Westerners would be well advised to study, maybe just adding a couple of authors who are not dead white males to modernize it a bit, or is a more thorough break from this idolized past needed? Or is the whole idea of a "best" education for all just ill-advised? Do people really need to read the Western canon at all?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;There will be a follow-up discussion released within the next week here, just for supporters like you!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Preservation Hill" by The Bevis Frond; Mark interviewed Nick Saloman on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem75-nick-saloman/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #75 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Image by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Plus Nietzsche's predecessor in critiquing the Enlightenment, Rousseau.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also, hear Seth's take on &lt;em &gt;Lysistrata &lt;/em &gt;, since he missed &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/04/22/ep188-lysistrata-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;that discussion &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Allan Bloom's 1987 best-seller about why students' disconnection from Great Books has led to relativism and ultimately nihilism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the role of the university in our democracy? Bloom relates from his many years teaching the problem with kids today: They're subject to the evils that Tocqueville warned us go with American-style democracy: They're conformist, superficial, focused on the practical at the expense of the soul, and worst of all, the democratic ethos taken intellectually means that they're indiscriminate: Everyone's ideas are equally good. Bloom thinks that a liberal education should be the cure for this: By connecting with brilliant minds of the past, witnessing them speaking across history to each other, we become part of the great conversation about truth and virtue. People need to at one point in their lives seriously consider the question, "What is man?" in relation to our highest aspirations as opposed to our common, base needs. We need to forget, at least temporarily, about training for a particular job or any other practical consideration, and just engage in thinking for thinking's sake, which is the thing that Aristotle said makes us most human.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Bloom bemoans that incoming students for the most part no longer have favorite books, that their music is all instant gratification, and that they see truth as relative. While it is democracy itself that tends to support making people like this, ironically, this condition means that we're no longer fit to intelligently participate in politics. Bloom thinks that we need to understand intellectual history to understand the foundations of liberty and so be able to defend it. In overthrowing elites like the church and the noble class, we should become independent thinkers, but what happens much more often is that we just go along with the crowd, and the crowd's ethos in our case involves an ignorant scientism that disregards the needs of the soul, a leveling of values the precludes any serious discussion of the good, and the related idea that every opinion is equally valid.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Bloom includes &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/12/07/episode-85-rawls-on-social-justice/" target="_blank"&gt;Rawls &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/02/05/episode-183-1-mill/" target="_blank"&gt;Mill &lt;/a &gt;in this condemnation. As you may recall, both of these thinkers were insistent that government shouldn't dictate the good to citizens (in Mill's case, this was a matter of not restricting speech), but Bloom is less concerned with the logical consequents of their philosophies than with the actual, social consequences, which in both cases Bloom diagnoses as nihilism: By denying values a central place in public norms, we promote mere legalism, pragmatism, i.e., a lack of values.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The full foursome is on board to reflect on how we feel about these critiques. Have our society and our educational system really produced a bunch of Nietzschean "last men"? Does Bloom's suggested program of Great Books (which is pretty much what Wes underwent at St. John's) actually produce better citizens?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Seth recorded a follow-up discussion to further get into the specifics of Bloom's diagnostic intellectual history, getting into his takes on Nietzsche, Freud, and Weber; be sure to sign up at the $5 support level to see it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451683200/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1451683200 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=c81203c9ff6648d2ad233df4764279de" target="_blank"&gt;The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="http://iwcenglish1.typepad.com/Documents/14434540-The-Closing-of-the-American-Mind.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;try this online version &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The image is by David Levine, drawn for &lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1987/11/05/undemocratic-vistas/" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1987/11/05/undemocratic-vistas/" target="_blank"&gt;New York Review of Books &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1987/11/05/undemocratic-vistas/" target="_blank"&gt;' review of Bloom's book by Martha Nussbaum &lt;/a &gt;, which is pretty scathing and well worth your time. She focuses on the elitism involved in Bloom's account; he's really only worried about the quality of education of his elite students, and recommends a regimen that will surely be out of reach of most people who actually have to worry about making a living.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Greatness (The Aspiration Song)" by TC &amp;amp;I; hear Mark's interview with singer/songwriter Colin Moulding on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem-74-colin-moulding/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #74 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Davidson's "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme" (1974) and Carnap's "Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology" (1950).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What does it mean to say that we grasp the world through a conceptual scheme? Are schemes different between cultures or even individuals, such that we can't &lt;em &gt;really &lt;/em &gt;understand each other? Davidson thinks that this doesn't make sense: For schemes to be really different and not just something like different coordinate systems that can be used to map a single plane, it has to be the case that you can't translate one scheme's concepts to concepts in the other scheme. But Davidson thinks total lack of translatability is incoherent: Just to be able to describe what the differences are between two sets of concepts means you're describing the foreign concepts in your own language, i.e., translating them. If a language were wholly untranslatable, we'd have to judge it not a language at all. The issue of partial untranslatability is more complicated, and we are rejoined by Lawrence "Dusty" Dallman (from our Sellars episode, which is relevant to Davidson's reasoning here) to help us disentangle the arguments and decide whether Davidson has characterized schemers like &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/12/24/ep86-thomas-kuhn/" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Kuhn &lt;/a &gt;plausibly.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The paper from Carnap comes 22 years after his &lt;em &gt;Aufbau &lt;/em &gt;project that we covered in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-67-carnap-on-17045971"&gt;ep. 67 &lt;/a &gt;, and is really a response to Quine's 1948 paper "On What There Is," which we covered in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-66-quine-on-17045937"&gt;ep. 66 &lt;/a &gt;. His point is that when we use a certain vocabulary, whether talking about physical objects ("the thing language") or mathematical objects or subatomic particles or whatever, we're not really (contra Quine) making metaphysical claims. So ontological questions like "Are there really numbers?" are just pretentious and don't really make sense. The vocabulary of mathematics involves numbers, so within that linguistic framework (that &lt;em &gt;scheme &lt;/em &gt;), yes, of course there are numbers, but the question of whether, outside of a particular framework, "numbers exist," is a pseudo-question. (&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-38-bertrand-15462639"&gt;Bertrand Russell &lt;/a &gt;, for one, worried about this, trying to reduce numbers to sets, which he found less metaphysically problematic.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So even though the Carnap was written well before Davidson's paper, we can take it as a potential response: A conceptual scheme is most sensibly construed as a domain-specific vocabulary. I can talk about the same social phenomena, for instance, in terms of bio-anthropology, sociology, or theologically (as the interplay of souls), and there's no clear reason why all the words in each vocabulary need to be reducible or translatable into words from the other vocabularies. Now, there might be other reasons why you'd want to reject the use altogether of some vocabulary (I'm looking at you, theology!), but it's not clear that we need to reject it merely on grounds of untranslatability, and this sort of theory-specific untranslatability is what Kuhnians (maybe) and others are talking about.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199288860/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199288860 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=c0d40ed5db01c4573441e99aada7075b" target="_blank"&gt;Buy this book of Davidson essays &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://projekt.ht.lu.se/fileadmin/user_upload/project/ccs/Davidson.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read the essay online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Darren Aronofsky's philosophical 2017 film about humanity's relationship to nature. We discuss the philosophical content of the film (Gnosticism, anyone?) and explore the relation between meaning and the sensuous aspects of an artwork. Can a work be both allegorical and yet have fully fleshed out characters and the other elements that make a film feel real? This was a very polarizing film; how do the circumstances of viewing affect reception? Mark and Wes are joined by filmmaker Tim Nicholas (&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/timnich" target="_blank"&gt;watch &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.somenotesonfilm.com/" target="_blank"&gt;read &lt;/a &gt;his work).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As always with these filmic episodes, you should really &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075KYFW1M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B075KYFW1M &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=e157abaf840a69411675ecd20c84ce39" target="_blank"&gt;see the film &lt;/a &gt;before listening to this. It's definitely worth your time, unless you are positively averse to artsy films or very sensitive to violence, as there are a couple of intense moments in it. Our discussion gets spoiler-laden after the first few minutes.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This was selected as a good case study to explore what we'd learned about authorial intent in &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/05/07/ep189-authorial-intent-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;our last episode.&lt;/a &gt;Aronofsky is a quintessential auteur, and he's been very forthcoming about the meaning of the film, and we prepared for this in part by watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mother+aronofsky" target="_blank"&gt;many clips, reviews, and interviews &lt;/a &gt;of him talking about it. Certainly having some idea of what to expect helps one to enjoy this film (which we all agree is very good despite pissing off many people), but is having the author tell you what it is the best way to achieve that?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Tim at one point quotes David Bordwell. &lt;a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2008/08/16/superheroes-for-sale/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's &lt;/a &gt;the article that quote is from, and &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/05/13/david-bordwell-shows-how-critics-make-meaning-out-of-films/" target="_blank"&gt;here's &lt;/a &gt;an article Tim wrote on Bordwell for the PEL blog. Late in the discussion Mark refers to Aronofsky's previous film, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_(2014_film)" target="_blank"&gt;Noah &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: “The Day of Wrath, That Day,” by Sarah McQuaid, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem72-sarah-mcquaid/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #72 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks to you, our supporters, who by contributing your hard-earned cash have enabled us to record extra discussions like this one. Enough folks expressed appreciation for our free-speech follow-up that we thought we'd do another one.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You'll want to listen to ep. 189 before this, of course. Our new text for this follow-up discussion is &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/#FouTheMea" target="_blank"&gt;from the Stanford Encyclopedia &lt;/a &gt;on theories of meaning, which we should probably have a proper episode on at some point in the future: Is meaning in the head or is it fixed by facts about the world? And how does this all connect with the episodes we had on meaning following &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/03/13/ep34-frege-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;Frege &lt;/a &gt;as well as our more recent episode on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/03/18/ep186-austin-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;J.L. Austin &lt;/a &gt;? We hope to use all this to make the weird thesis of Knapp and Michaels more clear.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Relatedly, "intention" might be more than what the author could articulate if you asked him or her: there may be unconscious psychological states involved, and depending on your theory of meaning, there could be social facts—such as facts about language or the situation—that contribute to what the meaning is. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I explicitly reviewed &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/04/25/ep138-1-john-searle/" target="_blank"&gt;our interview with Searle &lt;/a &gt;to explore the potential comparison his effort to remove from our ontology some perceived intermediate between us and the object perceived and Knapp and Michael's effort to remove this entity that they accuse Hirsch and the New Critics of positing between the reader and the author's meaning. Just as Searle talks about how we should then talk about cases of mistaken perception (the whole reason that someone might want to posit such an entity, e.g., if I perceive a bent stick that is really just a straight stick in water, there must be some bent-stick mental entity that I'm perceiving; Searle thinks this is wrong), we can talk about what's really going on when we wrongly perceive a meaning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You may also be interested in Wimsatt/Beardsley's thoughts on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_fallacy" target="_blank"&gt;the affective fallacy &lt;/a &gt;, a further New Criticism specification beyond the intentional fallacy, where they say that the reader's response to a text is not a measure of the work's value.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To give ourselves an example to think about regarding interpretation, we turned to another New Critic, T.S. Eliot, and his poem, "&lt;a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/44212/the-love-song-of-j-alfred-prufrock" target="_blank"&gt;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock &lt;/a &gt;." &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Song_of_J._Alfred_Prufrock#Themes_and_interpretation" target="_blank"&gt;Wikipedia claims to tell us what this poem means &lt;/a &gt;. Wes also brings up critic James Wood, whom you can &lt;a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/james-wood-upstate-review/" target="_blank"&gt;read about here &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On four essays about how to interpret artworks: “The Intentional Fallacy” by W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley (1946), "The Death of the Author" by Roland Barthes (1967), "What is an Author?" by Michel Foucault (1969), and “Against Theory” by Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels (1982).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When you're trying to figure out what, say, a poem means, isn't the best way to do that to just ask the author, if he or she is available? Or maybe to see if the author wrote in a contemporary diary any notes about the poem? According to "New Critics" Wimsatt and Beardsley, no, we should forget about anything external to the work itself. Well, OK, yes, understanding things like the customs or use of language at the time something was written, or even how an author idiosyncratically used a particular phrase, can be helpful, this is still different than relying on the author to simply tell you what it means. Do authors really have a privileged vantage on the meaning of a work? (&lt;a href="https://american-poetry-and-the-self12.wikispaces.com/file/view/Wimsatt+%26+Beardsley,+Intentional+Fallacy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the article &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Barthes and Foucault likewise argue against the cult of genius that places the author's personality and intentions at the center of art criticism. Barthes stresses that the work is not the product of a singular intellect but is a "tissue of citations," i.e. artists are channeling everything they've been influenced by. These citations all converge on the reader, who should be in charge of determining the work's meaning, not the author. The work in itself always admits of multiple interpretations, whatever the author might have intended, and in fact once something is written down, it becomes in a certain way autonomous, independent of the author, in effect speaking for itself; Barthes says that "every text is eternally written here and now." (&lt;a href="http://ncadjarmstrong.com/year-2-media-cultures-print/the_death_of_the_author.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the article &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Foucault agrees that we should lose the image of the genius behind the work, and compares this loss to Nietzsche's "God is dead," in that the task in so declaring in both cases is to figure out all the implications of this absence. He argues that the artist's name serves as a social classificatory function: "Aristotle" refers less crucially to a specific person (we're not even totally sure that all the texts attributed to him were by the same person) but as a way of marking certain texts with distinction and historical importance. He thinks that getting rid of the author as tyrant over a work's meaning opens up space for numerous kinds of interpretations. (&lt;a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~cstroupe/handouts/8906/Foucault_what_is_an_author.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the article &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Both the Foucault and Barthes articles are overly dramatic. Yes, the romantics were perhaps going too far in the worship of individual geniuses, ignoring the similarities between the activity of today's creators and the long history in which storytellers were just relating shared cultural tropes. Yes, artists are synthesizers of influences, and even the tools of craft use to synthesize those influences are largely not original to any one artist, but the final product that you are experiencing was still designed by someone, and the social cost to devaluing (and so discouraging) that activity is perhaps higher than the benefit of freeing listeners from the worship of genius.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Knapp and Michaels first present E.D. Hirsch (who had responded to Wimsatt/Michaels in 1967) as a defender of authorial intent, but then say that both Hirsch and the New Critics have it wrong: The intended meaning just IS the work's meaning. It's not that the work gains its meaning from a meaning in the author's head; there aren't two meaning-entities (one in the work and one in the head), but just one, and it's right there in the work so long as it really is an authentic instance of language. To illustrate: even if some marks on a rock looked like language, if there was no author with an intended meaning, then we'd have to say that it was just a coincidental resemblance, that no language was on the rock at all. The authors conclude that because there is no distance between the meaning to be understood and the author's intended meaning, there is no role for literary theory at all. This seems to all four of us an unwarranted stretch; there's still the problem of figuring out what a work means, and there's still room for multiple interpretations, and theory is a matter of establishing different sorts of interpretations. Understanding &lt;em &gt;that &lt;/em &gt;the utterance has an intended meaning is different than understanding &lt;em &gt;what &lt;/em &gt;that meaning is. (&lt;a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bc01/f683dd50ec4f99f0358f2d7cef8a9701b6ce.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the article &lt;/a &gt;.)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;After listening to this, $5 supporters can check out the follow-up discussion that Mark and Wes had trying to make sense of the issues of linguistic meaning raised here (you can get some of that through &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/#FouTheMea" target="_blank"&gt;this Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article &lt;/a &gt;on Paul Grice and others) and talk a bit about interpreting a T.S.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We are rejoined by actresses Lucy Lawless and Emily Perkins to discuss Aristophanes's bawdy play. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/not-ep-188-w-18157714" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to us perform it first &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Supplementary readings included Jeffery Henderson's introduction to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0941051021/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0941051021 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=7221e5d9eb505623563dc0270daa2f33" target="_blank"&gt;his 1988 translation &lt;/a &gt;of the play; "&lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Sexual_Humor_and_Harmony_in_Lysistrata.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Sexual Humor and Harmony in Lysistrata &lt;/a &gt;" by Jay M. Semel (1981); and "&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/269802" target="_blank"&gt;The 'Female Intruder' Reconsidered: Women in Aristophanes' Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae &lt;/a &gt;" by Helene P. Foley (1982).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss the play in terms of a clash between the &lt;em &gt;oikos &lt;/em &gt;(home) and &lt;em &gt;polis &lt;/em &gt;(city). Women were taken to have rights and responsibilities in the &lt;em &gt;oikos &lt;/em &gt;, but none in the &lt;em &gt;polis &lt;/em &gt;. Unlike in tragedies like &lt;em &gt;Antigone &lt;/em &gt;, where the female lead adopts assertive, "male" traits to "intrude" into the &lt;em &gt;polis &lt;/em &gt;, Lysistrata exerts political power by making use of &lt;em &gt;oikos &lt;/em &gt;values, i.e., by encouraging women to use the the type of power traditionally associated with women, and so ultimately her "revolution" is not revolutionary at all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We explore the various feminist and anti-feminist elements in the play, and try to relate it to the present: Women were oppressed because sex was (and is!) seen as inherently dangerous, as disruptive to political life. Can "make love, not war" be a politically effective slogan now? Given that women are now much less restricted to particular roles, what do we make of claims that are still made now that if women ran things, we'd have a lot less war? What would it be for a woman in politics now to exert her "feminine attributes" to gain power in the way Lysistrata does? Given how messed up Ancient Greek society was, does this play have anything to teach us?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Early on we talk about four different translations of the same passage; &lt;a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/lithum/gallo/weibgen.html" target="_blank"&gt;here's &lt;/a &gt;where you can find what we were looking at.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rGTuuj-aTJs" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the trailer for &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rGTuuj-aTJs" target="_blank"&gt;Chi-Raq &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, Spike Lee's modern take on the play.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Women of Industry (ABWA Charm)" by Jill Sobule, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem18-jill-sobule-takes-america-back/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #18 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;The PEL Players return to perform Aristophanes's comedy (first performed in 411 B.C.) about using a sex strike to stop war, using &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0941051021/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0941051021 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=a9d556c8cdbf043a396152777a0e7846" target="_blank"&gt;Jeffrey Henderson's 1988 translation &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark (old men's chorus leader), Wes (old men's chorus and Athenian), Dylan (old men's chorus), and Seth (Spartan sentry) are joined once again by TV's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Lawless" target="_blank"&gt;Lucy Lawless &lt;/a &gt;(Xena Warrior Princess, Ash vs. Evil Dead, Spartacus, Battlestar Galactica, etc.) as Lysistrata and Broadway's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Youmans" target="_blank"&gt;Bill Youmans &lt;/a &gt;(hear &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/10/16/ep149-plato-crito-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;his past performance for us of Crito &lt;/a &gt;) as the Athenian magistrate and Athenian ambassador. Plus, new fan &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Perkins" target="_blank"&gt;Emily Perkins &lt;/a &gt;(she was the girl in the TV mini-series of Stephen King's &lt;em &gt;It &lt;/em &gt;and starred in the &lt;em &gt;Ginger Snaps &lt;/em &gt;movies) as the young Athenian wife Myrrhine as well as the Spartan Lampito and several other small old and young woman parts. (The young women are holding the sex strike while the old women have taken over the treasury in the Citadel of Athena to stop funds from going to the war.) Bill brought along his fellow cast member in the current &lt;a href="http://carouselbroadway.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Broadway production of &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://carouselbroadway.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Carousel &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ericaspyres.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Erica Spyres &lt;/a &gt;, to play Lysistrata's co-conspirator Calonice, the old women's chorus leader, and other parts. Finally, actor/musician &lt;a href="https://www.aarondavidgleason.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Aaron David Gleason &lt;/a &gt;(soon to be featured on the &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music podcast &lt;/a &gt;) joined in to play the young Athenian soldier Rodney Balling (husband of Myrrhine) as well as the Spartan ambassador (who sings!) and joined the old man's chorus.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We start out by giving a bit of historical context and explaining some of the weird conventions of the play, then give a "cold read" of the full script (meaning this was not rehearsed, though the result has been edited to smooth things out and add some sound effects and a little music), then talk for another ten minutes after we're done about what we just read. Is this the feminist tract that history presents it as?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As you can see in the picture, this was performed via remote conference call. Each participant recorded him or herself locally, which explains the difference in sound quality among participants, but I've done my best to smooth everything out. The giggling and a few actual scene-breaking comments were carefully left in, though, to help convey how damn fun this was. Henderson's translation uses a modern idiom (so this doesn't sound like Shakespeare, which would be just as remote from the original Greek as what you're hearing here), and presents the Spartan foreigners as having Russian accents.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We'll be releasing as Partially Examined Life episode 188 a full discussion of the play, bringing back Lucy and Emily as guests to help us work out the relation between feminine power (and sex) and politics both for the Ancient Greeks and for us now. What does it really mean to say "make love not war," and does the increasing presence of female political leaders portend any changes of the sort that &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-42-feminists-15462982" target="_blank"&gt;Charlotte Perkins Gilman &lt;/a &gt;predicted?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes continue the discussion from &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-187-limits-of-17943039" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 187 &lt;/a &gt;. We watched some Jordan Peterson, so we talk about his position a bit, and about the appropriateness of organizations encouraging certain kinds of speech, the offense principle, the difference (and overlap!) between good-faith arguments and insults, conspiracy theories, "incoherence arguments" like Fish's (also used by Kant, Rand, and others), and "fundamental moral principles": Does that concept even make sense given that any principle requires judgement and probably sub-principles to apply it to real situations?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/E9PxdJNIc6w" target="_blank"&gt;Here's &lt;/a &gt;the short clip of Peterson talking about the psychological necessity for unrestricted speech, which is an excerpt from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/eVvS3L_aBV4" target="_blank"&gt;this talk &lt;/a &gt;. We also watched &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ScSt8A-QjL8" target="_blank"&gt;this other talk &lt;/a &gt;ostensibly about free speech, which was considerably less helpful. As a side note, this effort got us into researching whether we should invest our energy into an episode reading Peterson's &lt;em &gt;Maps of Meaning &lt;/em &gt;, and the current thought is probably not. See &lt;a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve" target="_blank"&gt;this &lt;/a &gt;&lt;a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/peterson-ganz-klein" target="_blank"&gt;this &lt;/a &gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/03/19/jordan-peterson-and-fascist-mysticism/" target="_blank"&gt;this &lt;/a &gt;. Given his popularity, if he were willing to come on the show himself, I'm pretty sure we'd do it.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/forbidden-knowledge/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's &lt;/a &gt;Sam Harris's interview with Charles Murray, which is worth listening to from the point of view of freedom of speech: Does Murray deserve the de-platforming and other reputational damage that he's received, and does Harris deserve to be praised or blamed for giving him a platform?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark's comments on fundamental moral principles and anti-foundationalism synthesize insights from &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/12/19/episode-154-1-sellars/" target="_blank"&gt;Sellars &lt;/a &gt;(anti-foundationalism in epistemology) with ideas in virtue ethics from &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/09/19/ep147-1-aristotle-incontinence/" target="_blank"&gt;Aristotle &lt;/a &gt;through &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-59-alasdair-17045441" target="_blank"&gt;MacIntyre &lt;/a &gt;, especially the idea of phronesis, i.e. practical wisdom.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Combine Man" by RHEMA, as discussed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem67-rhema/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #67 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes, Mark, Dylan, and Seth have a free-form discussion on contemporary issues regarding potential restrictions on speech, drawing on Stanley Fish's “&lt;a href="http://www.kolhamevaser.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/fish-pdf.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;There’s No Such Thing as Free Speech, and It’s a Good Thing, Too &lt;/a &gt;” (1994) and Joel Feinberg’s “&lt;a href="https://my.ilstu.edu/~jkshapi/Feinberg_Limits%20to%20Free%20Expression.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Limits to the Free Expression of Opinion &lt;/a &gt;” (1975), and also on David van Mill's Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article, "&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/" target="_blank"&gt;Freedom of Speech &lt;/a &gt;," John Milton's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/areopagitica/text.html" target="_blank"&gt;Areopagitica &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1644), and J.S. Mill's &lt;em &gt;On Liberty &lt;/em &gt;per our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-183-mill-on-16804983"&gt;ep. 183 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What are the legitimate limits on free speech? Mill argues that speech can be legally limited and/or socially censured when it's harmful, but what does that mean? Philosopher of law Feinberg gives several categories of speech that can be regulated and discusses the difficulties in applying each category: defamation (including "malicious truth"), invasions of privacy, causing panic, actions expected to provoke retaliatory violence ("fighting words"), and incitement to crime. He does not consider "sedition" legitimate to prohibit (Mill and &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/06/19/ep166-1-spinoza-politics/" target="_blank"&gt;Spinoza &lt;/a &gt;did). However, he does consider (in "&lt;a href="http://www.klindeman.com/uploads/3/8/2/2/38221431/feinberg_-_offense_to_others.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Offensive Nuisances &lt;/a &gt;," a chapter from a different book that some of us read part of, &lt;em &gt;The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, Offense to Others &lt;/em &gt;, from 1985) that there are some actions that are not overtly harmful but that, just through their being offensive according to community standards (such as sex acts in public), can be legitimately prohibited.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Stanford article &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#IntBouDeb" target="_blank"&gt;begins &lt;/a &gt;by arguing that free speech isn't an end it itself; we don't just want to hear people talk. We value unrestricted speech for some particular reasons. For instance, Mill and Milton argue that we need it to make sure that politically and even psychologically we don't stagnate. Ideas need to be regularly challenged both to make the wisest possible decisions in what to believe (having all ideas on the table and vigorously defended by someone) and in gaining a better understanding of our ideas through having to defend them against all comers. However, that means that when some particular speech act is detrimental to those goals, it's a candidate for censure. Given the history of discrimination in the USA, does it help us to have vigorous debates going on now about whether racial minorities are inferior to whites? Or does the crankish insistence of racists just demoralize us and make deliberative conversation as a practical matter more difficult?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Stanley Fish argues that all claims of "free speech" have within them an underlying commitment to some ideology that really favors some kinds of speech over others. As a Milton scholar, he discusses the &lt;em &gt;Areopagitica &lt;/em &gt;, which is an argument against having a central government censor who would review all books before publication, as not inconsistent when Milton clarifies that of course he doesn't mean that Catholic doctrines should be freely expressed. Milton is arguing for open deliberation, and "popery," as he calls it, requires us to not deliberate for ourselves, but to submit in all our judgments to the infallible pope. To modernize and generalize this, the point is that free speech is based on liberal values, and so allowing attacks on the institution that allows for this freedom is self-defeating. (Karl Popper called this the "&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance" target="_blank"&gt;paradox of tolerance &lt;/a &gt;.")&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes argues that no, we have to bite the bullet: A liberal society is not one that discourages anti-liberal speech, but one with liberal institutions that allow for all nonharmful speech, and that the standard for harm should be narrowly interpreted as applying only to tangible harms of particular people and clear and present danger.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Most hate speech, on this view, should be legally permissible, and certainly any writing should be. If something is merely offensive, then per Feinberg, it should be allowed if it's reasonably easy to turn away from it. Simply don't read that book, or don't go to that rally.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Things become more difficult when we move from legal matters to what organizational policies such as those of campuses or newspapers should or shouldn't prohibit; this is the question of venue. According to Wes, private organizations, unlike the state, can set whatever kinds of rules they want to create their desired speech climate. But clearly permissibility is not the same as advisability, and so while campuses and businesses are allowed to crack down on speech, this does cause the same kinds of harms about open deliberation that Mill is worried about, and if &lt;em &gt;all &lt;/em &gt;news outlets and venues end up rejecting some idea as too unpalatable to be allowed expression, then wouldn't that idea be marginalized to such an extent that it doesn't fulfill its function (according to Mill) of being there to help us toughen ourselves in having to confront it?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Fish describes any institution as having an underlying mission, and (according to Mark) this is not necessarily something that can be simply spelled out in its bylaws, but requires interrogation by its members: What are we really trying to do here? This provides a grounds for a college or other institution to grapple with particular cases. Does allowing a Nazi group to meet on campus, for instance, help or hinder this cause? Does the prohibition cause more trouble than simply allowing the occurrence to happen? Fish doesn't believe that simply claiming "free speech" should stop all conversation about what's actually appropriate. As an anti-foundationalist, he believes that rights such as speech are achievements of political struggle, not God-given, transcendent entities, and so a claim to have a right to some speech is a move in a game that is inescapably political. In every context, there are built-in restrictions on what counts as a "legal move" (think Wittgenstein's language games), so that if you're ordering a pizza, there are only certain utterances that will even make sense to the person on the other end of the phone. In an academic setting, students are expected to sit quietly until question and answer time comes, and/or to raise their hands; the rules may be different or more or less enforced in different classes, but clearly if you just start yelling so that no one can hear anything else and don't stop, then you're over the line. So there's always a line, always some restriction, and where that line is is set according to the politics of those in power, and if you want to argue about moving the line, then you're making a political move as well. Neither side has recourse to a transcendent ideal of "free speech" to set the line in one particular place; using the term is just a (often highly successful!) rhetorical device.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The same sort of interrogation of our underlying purposes and how we've set lines in the past, of course, should apply to whole societies, and in this way Fish's argument is similar to a historical one based on the &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/06/07/episode-3-hobbess-leviathan-the-social-contract/" target="_blank"&gt;social contract &lt;/a &gt;. Have we, in being part of society, agreed implicitly not to advocate for its destruction (sedition), not to seek to delegitimize the political participation of some group of our fellow citizens (arguably what hate speech does), or not to break common norms of decency (obscenity laws)? How particular cases are interpreted is not a matter of objective application of the principle of free speech and its related harm principle, but are matters of politics. Fish does not think that this taint of the "political" makes all arguments equally forceful (relativism) or devalues the sort of critical thinking that Feinberg is engaged in, but it does take the wind out of the sails of free-speech absolutists who think that we have to allow the expression of ideas like Holocaust denial and white supremacy. These should be matters of case-by-case deliberation, looking at the actual harms that allowing these practices are likely to bring or not bring, and reflecting on what kind of speech climate best aligns with human flourishing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Note that Mark and Wes continued the conversation on a supporter-only, 90-minute &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/18000549"&gt;follow-up &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195093836/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195093836 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=87851a838c11e25a60f453811b5c100c" target="_blank"&gt;Buy Fish's book &lt;/a &gt;or read &lt;a href="http://www.kolhamevaser.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/fish-pdf.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a shortened version of the article &lt;/a &gt;online. &lt;a href="https://my.ilstu.edu/~jkshapi/Feinberg_Limits%20to%20Free%20Expression.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the Feinberg article on the harm principle &lt;/a &gt;online, or buy his books from the &lt;em &gt;Moral Limits of the Criminal Law &lt;/em &gt;series, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195046641/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195046641 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=d8f275d58e22b32668037d2e91fbd293" target="_blank"&gt;Harm to Others &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;and &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195052153/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195052153 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=02c2bcae6b59a8bc28e47deb802825a8" target="_blank"&gt;Offense to Others &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;How to Do Things with Words &lt;/em &gt;, a lecture series delivered in 1955.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the relationship between language and the world? According to Austin, philosophers have generally taken language as providing descriptions: A sentence is true if it correctly describes some state of affairs. But what about sentences like "I promise…"? Austin says that when you say that, you're not describing your inner state or predicting your future behavior, but performing a verbal action, a ritual that relies for its success on the circumstances of your utterance. For instance, you can't legitimately promise something beyond your control, can't really make a promise to a non-person, aren't really making a promise if you're saying it as a line in a play you're acting in, etc. And yes, if you have no intention of keeping the promise, that's another way in which it can "go wrong," though in that case you really have made a promise (unless, arguably, you had your fingers crossed, but that's just your bad excuse!).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Austin calls promising, betting, apologizing, issuing a verdict, and similar verbal actions &lt;em &gt;performatives &lt;/em &gt;, to contrast them to descriptive statements, and uses this kind of sentence to turn around our whole way of looking at language. These aren't just fringe cases in our language, he thinks, but actually, descriptions will end up being performatives too: "The dog is here" is really "I hereby state that the dog is here." Or is it? What's added in the second formulation is some kind of picture of the circumstance of utterance. My action could be merely one of stating, but it could also be one of warning ("The dog is here!"), concluding, complaining, etc. For Austin, analyzing the truth or falsity of a sentence doesn't get much of what's interesting about activity: You need to look at the whole speech act.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You might recall Wittgenstein's doctrine in the &lt;em &gt;Investigations &lt;/em &gt;(see our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-55-on-17043946" target="_blank"&gt;episode 55 &lt;/a &gt;) that "meaning is use." The meaning of "I promise…" is only understood if you understand the social convention of promising. Austin makes this more precise, and I'll give you some of his terminology here. Every successful utterance can be analyzed in terms of its locution (the actual sentence uttered along with its dictionary meaning and what specifically in the world it is allegedly about); its illocution (how is it meant to work as a performative?); and its perlocution (what intended effects not dictated by convention, i.e., by its illocutionary aspect, does the utterance achieve?). This analysis is supposed to allow us to, for instance, banish as pseudo-problems significant questions in philosophy, including perhaps all of ethics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So simple and clear, right? OK, not so simple and clear, and Seth is back to join Mark, Wes, and Dylan to try to explain it all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674411528/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674411528 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=df635df5cb2ae5eddd2662399c3a72b6" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/HowToDoThingsWithWordsAUSTIN" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Toward the end, I bring up the idea that ethical claims are actually just expressions of attitude.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the classic Greek epic poem, written ca. 750 BCE and translated by our guest &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Wilson" target="_blank"&gt;Emily Wilson &lt;/a &gt;(of the University of Pennsylvania) in 2018.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does this story of "heroes" have anything to teach us about ethics? Emily wrote an 80-page introduction to her new translation laying out the issues, including "hospitality" as a political tool, the value for status and identity of one's home (including your family and slaves), and the tension between strangeness and familiarity. Can time and change really be undone?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan engage our guest about what it is to translate a singable poem from a dead language: Given that there will always be a gap in meaning between the Greek and the English, what sorts of liberties are and aren't called for, to make the thing actually readable and enjoyable for modern audiences? How can translation obscure troubling social issues raised by the text?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The primary political unit of the time being described in the story (the twelfth or thirteenth century BCE) in Greece was the &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oikos" target="_blank"&gt;oikos &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which is the family, but refers really to the whole estate. Odysseus has been gone from home for 20 years as the story begins, having left to join the Trojan war, and there are over 100 suitors vying for his wife Penelope. They do this by staying at his home and feasting constantly, and by thus eating his estate (which should rightly go to his son Telemachus, who was a baby when Odysseus left) they are described as in effect eating Odysseus himself. So the story is in a way about trying to put his oikos back together, and with divine help, he's able to even in his physical appearance eventually reproduce his situation from before his departure. In this way, the text raises the question, "Can you really go home again?"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The way that alliances are formed between these estates is through &lt;em &gt;xenia &lt;/em &gt;, which is the guest-host relationship, and Odysseus's whole journey (and Telemachus also takes a shorter journey, in an effort to find news of his father) is an exploration of the ways in which xenia can go right or wrong. For example, in the famous episode of Polyphemus the cyclops, Odysseus trespasses with some of his men into the cyclops's home, eats some of his food, and basically demands hospitality of his host, who instead eats some of the men. Odysseus uses this as an excuse to blind, steal from, and humiliate the cyclops, whose father is the sea-god Poseidon. And thus Odysseus's subsequent sea voyages are screwed.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So, in what way is Odysseus a hero? You may want to consult &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/09/19/ep147-1-aristotle-incontinence/" target="_blank"&gt;our episode &lt;/a &gt;on the intellectual virtues according to Aristotle. The text claims that he has &lt;em &gt;deinotes &lt;/em &gt;, or cleverness, but he does some pretty dumb things in the text, such as actually yell out his name at the cyclops as they're leaving, and so brings on Poseidon's curse. Many of his lies and disguises are unnecessary, and he certainly doesn't explore different ways of resolving the situation of the suitors living in his house, who might have cleared out had he just confronted them in some way instead of setting forth to kill them all. But hey, they violated xeniaFinally, we address the role of the gods in the story. Are they necessary? Do they just represent the inner urgings of the characters? Doesn't it remove any tension in the story to know that Athena is going to basically fix all of Odysseus's battles for him? We applaud Emily for making this very weird text very readable and fully enjoyable well beyond its obvious educational value as one of the most influential texts in history.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2oHUOnK" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;. If you can't just go read this right now, and don't know the basic story and character names, we suggest you check out &lt;a href="http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/The_Odyssey" target="_blank"&gt;a summary &lt;/a &gt;, as we pretty much jump right to discussing the themes and don't start by laying out the story.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Check out Emily's articles relevant to our discussion, like "&lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/106497/rethinking-other-antiquity-erich-gruen" target="_blank"&gt;The Origins of Foreigners &lt;/a &gt;" (2012) and "&lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/117430/helen-troy-beauty-myth-devastation-ruby-blondell-reviewed" target="_blank"&gt;Slut-Shaming Helen of Troy &lt;/a &gt;" (2014).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;A key past PEL episode mentioned is &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/07/06/ep119-1-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;Ep. 119 &lt;/a &gt;on Nietzsche's &lt;em &gt;Birth of Tragedy &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Homer image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Tiny Broken Boats" by Arrica Rose, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem66-arrica-rose/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #66 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Blaise Pascal's &lt;em &gt;Pensées &lt;/em &gt;(1670).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is it rational to have religious faith? You're likely familiar with "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager" target="_blank"&gt;Pascal's Wager &lt;/a &gt;," one of the most famous arguments for the existence of God, but it's not clear that Pascal bought into the argument as it is usually understood.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To see why, you have to get Pascal's picture of human nature, which is surprisingly insightful, and is what Mark, Wes, and Dylan spend most of this episode discussing. Pascal thinks that humanity in its actuality is thoroughly wretched. We're morally wretched: innately selfish, really despising each other, vain, self-deceiving, unable to focus on the good, always chasing after one imaginary lure or other. We're epistemically wretched: Our reason deceives us, our senses deceive us, our instincts are self-destructive, and our imagination, again, is the worst. Pascal believes that we need to follow "heart" over reason, but that doesn't mean what we mean, e.g., in talking about romantic love, which Pascal sees as exactly the kind of destructive, ultimately imaginary drive that I've just been describing. Our greatness comes from realizing our wretchedness, from the fact that we have ideals that let us see our depravity, and he thinks that these come from God. And since "God" qua infinite being is nothing that we could really understand, much less have a personal relationship with, he thinks that Jesus is absolutely essential for authentic religiosity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To return to the wager: Yes, reason is inadequate to tell you definitively whether or not to believe (though Pascal thinks that reason does tell you that it's not unreasonable to believe, and thinks that the miracles were and are pretty darn properly convincing to people on purely rational grounds), so all those arguments by Descartes and St. Thomas are for naught.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Pascal does, then, say that the risk you incur by believing is negligible: Human life and its non-religious pursuits are all such crap that you're not giving up anything by putting all your energy toward God. And on the other side, if you "bet against God," then you're risking your eternal soul, potentially winning eternal bliss if the Christian God is real. But you can't actually just "choose" to believe; that's not how human psychology works, and Pascal knows this. You can, however, go through the motions: Go to church, open yourself toward God, and at the very least, virtue will be its own reward, and with grace, you'll end up a real believer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Pascal has anticipated your objections: What if Zeus or some other God is the real one? Well, that's why he spends so much time arguing that only Christianity accurately describes human nature, both in laying out our wretchedness and giving us the cure for it. Those other alleged gods just wouldn't do the trick, so we can rule them out (you'll have to actually read the book to get the details of his arguments here). And simply not making a choice is not an option, and deciding not to care about the question is irresponsible to the point of monstrous.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Again, the wager is not the main focus of our discussion, but Pascal's take on our psychology, which includes some surprising verdicts about political authority and tradition. Pascal is liberal enough that he recognizes the arbitrariness and illusory character of a lot of this, but he also understands how these things are emergent properties of human nature, and as such are better guides to our action than the vain flights of fancy of revolutionary political philosophers.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Pascal's biography is probably the most interesting thing about him; I recommend &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Oaze-KMAmAc" target="_blank"&gt;this account &lt;/a &gt;by Will Durant, which describes his work in science and mathematics before his turn to religion, as well as his other famous book, &lt;em &gt;Lettres Provinciales &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140446451/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140446451 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=aca6cda7391ab7611596ca9cac2006bf" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the Penguin edition &lt;/a &gt;that we all used to prep, or take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm" target="_blank"&gt;the differently organized Trotter translation &lt;/a &gt;free online.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "44 Days" by Dutch Henry, written and sung by Todd Long, as interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem-34-todd-long-dont-have-to-say-frontman/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #34 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Pascal picture by &lt;a href="http://drewblom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Drew Blom &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Robert M. Pirsig's philosophical, autobiographical novel from 1974.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the relationship between science and values? Pirsig thinks that modern rationality, by insisting on the fundamental distinction between objects (matter) and subjects (people), labels value judgments as irrational. Society therefore largely ignores aesthetic considerations in the buildings and machines that litter our landscape.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;People rebel against this ugly commercialism by rejecting technology altogether, and Pirsig thinks this is a mistake. If we realize that value judgments (where we sense "Quality") are fundamentally a part of experience, that they drive what what we consider "rational" (e.g. a "good" scientific explanation) in the first place, then we can stop with the hippie rebellion and more sensibly and peacefully co-exist with technology. Though the book is not about historical Zen, it is about keeping centered, connected, and in the moment.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Featuring guest participant David Buchanan. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/01/06/now-taking-questions-on-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Freeway" by Mark Lint and Stevie P. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/02/03/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-mark-lint-and-stevie-p-big-summer-2011-reunion/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty" (1859). If we disapprove of certain behaviors, when is it okay to prohibit them legally? What about just shaming people for engaging in them? How much shaming is too much? Mill's famous "harm principle" says that we should permit anything unless it harms other people. But what constitutes "harm"? If I call you by a racial slur, have I harmed you? If I teach your children ideas or behaviors you don't approve of, without your permission, have I harmed you? Or them?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mill was not just concerned with paternalistic laws, but with other kinds of social pressures. We should not let the tyranny of custom make us all into meek conformists. We need to promote individuality, diversity, eccentricity. This is the only way to allow genius to flourish. Individuals' "experiments in living," even though most of these may just be foolish, ultimately serve to help us progress.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;And of course, central to this freedom of living is freedom of thought, and what's very closely related, freedom of speech. Even if nearly all of us find some ideas objectionable, we need to let them be stated, not just out of principle, but because we want bad ideas to be engaged, to be actively refuted. If we all agree on something, we take it for granted and forget why we believe it; having to defend it makes us understand it better. Ideas need to compete in daylight if we expect truth to prevail over time.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan bring this debate to current issues and explore some of the less expected aspects of Mill's view, such as his views on public education (he's for universal education, but against government providing it), imperialism (maybe it's OK to be paternalistic when dealing with illiberal cultures), and economics (because economic activity by definition involves others, it does potentially fall under the harm principle; Mill's "libertarianism" doesn't leave companies to deal with employees and customers however they see fit).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0915144433/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0915144433 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=33987236e6bad6b3457c1ca6c9f9efd0" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901" target="_blank"&gt;read it for free online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Flavor" by Tori Amos from &lt;em &gt;Gold Dust &lt;/em &gt;(2012), featuring strings by John Philip Shenale, who was interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem12-john-philip-shenale-string-arranger-composer-producer/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #12 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mill image by &lt;a href="http://charlesvalsechi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Valsechi &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;To what extent has our podcast changed in reaction to current politics? Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan reflect back on our year, discuss how we select texts, and give some thumbnail sketches of potential topics. Want to hear about &lt;em &gt;Planet of the Apes &lt;/em &gt;? Charlie Brown? Pink Floyd? Joan Didion? Neal Gaiman? Maybe more philosophy-adjacent texts following what we did with Darwin and &lt;em &gt;The Wealth of Nations &lt;/em &gt;? Or quit with the pop culture already and get to Malebranche, Von Mises, and Mill!?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So when we talk about something that isn't philosophy, what are we doing exactly? Trying to pull out the philosophical issues, or treating literature qua literature and film qua film? Do we care what the author says about the work? If he or she denies any philosophical intentions, are we doing wrong by reading it into the work anyway?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes talks about his forays into film analysis (check out &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/07/31/back-to-the-father-the-incest-driven-plot-of-back-to-the-future/" target="_blank"&gt;this &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/09/08/on-integrative-encounters-of-the-cinematic-variety-reflections-on-close-encounters-of-the-third-kind-on-its-40th-anniversary/" target="_blank"&gt;this &lt;/a &gt;, &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/05/27/the-deus-in-ex-machina/" target="_blank"&gt;this &lt;/a &gt;, and especially &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/01/15/frankenstein-and-ambition-part-1/" target="_blank"&gt;this &lt;/a &gt;), Seth kvetches about the poor job modern movies do in treating philosophical issues, Mark talks about reactions to our American Indian episode (&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/11/24/on-reactions-to-our-american-indian-episode/" target="_blank"&gt;read the blog post on this &lt;/a &gt;), and Dylan explains the St. John's way of treating any text intelligently.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "The Evening Standard" from Mark Lint's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://marklint.com/BlackJellyBeans.html" target="_blank"&gt;Black Jelly Beans &amp;amp; Smokes &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, recorded around 1992.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The image for this ep is by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Solomon.grundy.39" target="_blank"&gt;Solomon Grundy &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil &lt;/em &gt;(1963).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are we still morally culpable if our entire society is corrupt? Arendt definitely thinks so, but has a number of criticisms of the handling of the 1961 trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. Israel used the spectacle to remind people of the horrors of the Holocaust, but missed the opportunity to explore what would make a really rather ordinary man a party to such heinous acts. They were committed to the view that he was a monster, when the reality, says Arendt, is more frightening. He was really more of a clown: a status-obsessed, cliche-spouting, self-pitying bureaucrat who, far from having no moral compass, was extremely dedicated to obeying a warped version of the Categorical Imperative: "Act in such a way that the Führer, if he knew your action, would approve it."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;She also had problems with the jurisdictional claim of Israel: Eichmann was tried by Israelis for crimes against the Jewish people. She thought that the Holocaust was not just the worst of a history of pogroms, but that genocide constituted a fundamentally new type of crime that needed clear philosophical analysis: The effort to snuff out a whole civilization is a crime against humanity as a whole beyond the individual murders involved. Arendt advocated for a permanent, international criminal court (which didn't materialize until &lt;a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/docs/ICCAtAGlanceEng.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2002 &lt;/a &gt;).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This constitutes a test case for our previous discussion of psychological &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/11/06/ep176-situationism-milgram-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;situationism &lt;/a &gt;: In a situation where the whole society is oriented toward evil, then the pull of duty runs counter to one's conscience, which is reined in just like in ordinary circumstances one's disruptive impulses are reined in, because conscience is disruptive in that milieu. Eichmann could have chosen not to participate in the way that he did, but considered this unthinkable; abandoning one's duty in that way "just wasn't done." All dissenting voices had been silenced. “It was not his fanaticism but his very conscience that prompted Eichmann to adopt his uncompromising attitude during the last year of the war" (from Ch. 8).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Arendt still thought that he deserved execution, that we are responsible for engaging in concrete moral thinking—grasping other people as real others and not just as labels or roles—no matter what the environment. But she thought it important that we not gloss over factual details for the sake of making a political point: Eichmann was not in a position to have "masterminded" the Holocaust as was alleged, never pulled a trigger himself or directly ordered an execution, though he did order many deportations, even after his immediate superior had ordered that they cease, knowing full well that most of those deported would be killed. She also wants to be realistic about the guilt of those who helped the Nazis either through active cooperation (e.g., Jewish leaders who worked with the Nazis to provide them with information on the Jews in the area and their property, before the Final Solution was in evidence) or through inaction, and describes countries like Denmark where the "machine" didn't work because local officials would not cooperate in handing over their Jews, and troops on the ground didn't have the heart to press through such resistance.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The full foursome tries to figure out why we assigned ourselves such depressing holiday reading and whether we in the modern day might be subject to any kind of comparable moral blindness to what was going on in Nazi Germany. How slippery is the slope when you start considering your main social ill the "problem" of immigrants? Does loyalty to a leader commit one to denying obvious truths that the leader denies?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143039881/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0143039881 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=24021fbd71220cb3eff413b9f9a2cc85" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://platypus1917.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/arendt_eichmanninjerusalem.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Hiding from the Face of God" from Judybats 2000; listen to me interview singer/songwriter Jeff Heiskell on Nakedly Examined Music &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/?s=heiskell" target="_blank"&gt;eps. 5 and 63 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Arendt image by &lt;a href="http://shaneaustinwood.weebly.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Shane Wood &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Psychology, the Briefer Course &lt;/em &gt;(1892), chapters on "The Self," "Will," and "Emotions."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Continuing from ep. 179, we talk about the various aspects of self: The "Me" (the part of me that I know) that's divided into physical, social, and spiritual aspects, and the "I" (the part of me that has experiences), which is pretty problematic, but which we need not posit as a "soul," but which should play some role in the problem of what unifies experience over time so that we consider it all belonging to the same person.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk briefly about James's influential theory of emotions, which suggests that an emotion is just our experience of certain physical feelings: Danger gives rise to increased heart rate, dry mouth, etc., and we feel those changes and call them "fear."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Finally, we discuss at length James's take on willing. To refresh James's overall theory of mind: An organism's activity basically involves various signals coming in through the senses and going out to produce reaction. This chain can reach to a greater or lesser extent into consciousness: from a reflex (mindless) action at one extreme, which might be or simply start as an instinct, or might have once been a choice but then became a habit. Attention (accompanied by memory) is the faculty that filters the confusion of the stream of experience into identifiable things. A voluntary action is one taken with a memory that such an action can be done (so it must have been done the first time by instinct, reflex, or chance) with a plan to produce the same effect.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This gives a partial picture of what "will" amounts to. It's not a single faculty, but a combination of different phenomena, mostly related to attention. You could consider every voluntary action to be "willed," but many such actions don't hold our attention more than a moment or are part of a habitual chain, such that they don't actually attract our attention unless something goes wrong. I might be thirsty and reach for the water in front of me while concentrating on something else. Did I "will" the action? Well, the only times we generally use that term is when there's some difficulty in the decision or the action: I reach for the water, but I'm very tired and have to overcome my tiredness to reach for it, as if the obstacle is saying "are you sure?" Or maybe the drink is whisky and I stop to think whether I’ve already had too much.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In short, these input-output chains can conflict, which then brings attention to bear, and when we do make a decision, that’s where the explicit “fiat” that we typically call “will” comes in (even though many more actions are voluntary and hence willed as opposed to against-your-will). James thinks that whichever idea is held in attention the longest tends to have causal efficacy. If my desire for the alcohol is great, then repeated acts of attention would be required to pull myself back from that desire and consider the idea that enough is enough. Insofar as we have to exert this kind of effort, that &lt;em &gt;really &lt;/em &gt;feels like will.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;With this picture established, we spend some time bickering about James’s stance regarding free will. He explicitly says that he’s not going to deal with that in this essay, that we can still talk about moral psychology with just the facts of temptation and effort as described above, and we can judge someone’s virtue from their apparent capacity to summon up such effort. As a scientist, James says that he’s committed to the idea that all actions have a physiological cause, yet he can distinguish phenomenologically between actions that seem like involuntary, reflex actions from ones that seem deliberative and voluntary. But are we really, metaphysically, free? The scientist must remain silent on this point, as metaphysics is outside the scope of science.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486416046/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0486416046 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=cc601fbcd4d1c9f0ef51c7d38286f123" target="_blank"&gt;Psychology: The Briefer Course &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/psychologybriefe00willuoft" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Principles of Psychology &lt;/em &gt;(1890) chapters 1 &amp;amp; 7, and &lt;em &gt;Psychology, the Briefer Course &lt;/em &gt;(1892), the chapters on "The Stream of Thought," "Habit," and some of "The Self."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Can we talk about the mind in a way that is both scientific and also does justice to our everyday experiences? James thought that previous philosophers talking about the mind weren't accurately reflecting how things actually seem to us when we introspect. The empiricists like Locke thought that the basic unit of mentality was the idea, and that particular mental states were combinations of ideas. Spiritualists like Descartes thought that mental states are faculties of a spirit. James found both of these views overly simplistic and ultimately uninformative. He stressed first and foremost that mental activities are in some way unknown to us correlated with brain activities (whether they literally &lt;em &gt;are &lt;/em &gt;brain activities is a metaphysical question that can be set aside during science), and that mentality was an evolutionary development, and so psychological explanations should take into account how the organism engages with its environment. These assumptions persist in modern psychology, but the addition that was very in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century, largely because of James, was introspection. In this way, James presages a lot of the findings of phenomenologists like Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre by being willing to say what experience is really like. James favored direct introspection even while acknowledging that introspective observations, like all observations, are often mistaken. The alternatives as he described them (in &lt;em &gt;Principles &lt;/em &gt;Ch. 7) are experimental psychology, which was coming into favor in Germany and bored James to tears, what with the incessant repetition required; and comparative psychology, which would administer surveys to large groups and bring animals, children, and the mentally impaired into their analyses. James thought that we should make use of all of these methods as applicable and not be the servant of any of them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In "The Stream of Thought" chapter, he reports that consciousness is not a concatenation of discrete ideas, but is a "blooming, buzzing confusion" out of which we make some sort of order, largely through the use of our attention: we pick out some things as salient, and the rest becomes an indistinct fringe. We talk through some of the features of this fringe and the puzzle of what constitutes personal identity, i.e., what makes a particular thought seem owned, what makes it hang together with the rest of the stream of consciousness.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In the second half of the discussion, we turn to habit, which logically comes before all this talk of consciousness, because once something is habitual, you don't need to bring it up before consciousness. James's whole picture of a person's interaction with the outside world is that of a pulse coming in (e.g., through a sense organ), and then a reaction pulse going back out. Sometimes these loops come all the way to consciousness, but sometimes they don't. There are plenty of reactions that are purely reflexes, other more complex ones that are still instinctual, and some that reach all the way into our awareness so that selective attention, deliberation, and/or potentially an effort of will are involved in producing the reaction. Habit is part of that dynamic, where something starts as perhaps a conscious choice or an instinctive reaction, and the more we do it, the more that pulse pathway gets burned into our organism (especially our very plastic brain) so that we're likely to act that same way in the future. James then has a lot of interesting things to say about how best to inculcate good habits and break bad ones.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486203816/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0486203816 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=761055762b10857a0b642e1cde41905e" target="_blank"&gt;The Principles of Psychology, Vol. 1 &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;or &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofpsyc01jameuoft" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Friedrich Nieztsche's 1888 book summarizing his thought and critiquing the founding myths of his society: traditional morality, free will, Socratic reason, and the idiocy of "Deutschland Uber Alles!"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nietzsche defends instinct as the source of values, but these instincts must be "spiritualized" into frenzied creativity. Nietzsche as artist is an appealing figure to us, but he also praises Napoleon and says lots of nice things about war as the antidote to a complacent society sliding into decline. He thinks we're all degenerates, but we can't help it. So what does he actually want from us?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nietzsche wrote this book in just over a week, and it's packed full of juicy quotes (like "What does not destroy me, makes me stronger") and psychological insights (e.g., virtue doesn't make you happy; being happy makes you tend to be virtuous). Wes, Mark, Dylan, and Seth sketch out the best and weirdest parts and try to figure out what Nietzsche would have to say about our world today, from social justice warriors to Louis CK.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140445145/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140445145 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=c46aff328458b3c7de5f677b2affd75e" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/11/10/episode-11-nietzsches-immoralism-what-is-ethics-anyway/" target="_blank"&gt;Episode 11 on &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/11/10/episode-11-nietzsches-immoralism-what-is-ethics-anyway/" target="_blank"&gt;The Genealogy of Morals &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/11/10/episode-11-nietzsches-immoralism-what-is-ethics-anyway/" target="_blank"&gt;(1887)&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/08/15/ep61-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;Episode 61 on his essay "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" (1873)&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/08/15/ep61-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;Episode 84 on his essay &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/08/15/ep61-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;The Gay Science &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/08/15/ep61-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;(1882)&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/07/06/ep119-1-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;Episode 119 on &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/07/06/ep119-1-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;The Birth of Tragedy &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/07/06/ep119-1-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;(1872)&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;Nietzsche picture by Genevieve Arnold.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Oblivion," written for this episode by Tyler Hislop.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;Hey, Patreon PEL supporters, to say thanks, we're starting earlier than announced on posting newly released Citizen Editions here. $5+ supporters will for sure get them at the same time as people signed up as Citizens at partiallyexaminedlife.com. Continued availability of ad-free eps at lower levels of support is TBD.&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The host of &lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Econtalk &lt;/a &gt;provides his take on our &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2017/10/16/ep174-1-adam-smith/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 174 &lt;/a &gt;on &lt;em &gt;The Wealth of Nations &lt;/em &gt;, and explores with us the idea of emergent economic order. As preparation, we all listened to &lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/06/don_boudreaux_m.html" target="_blank"&gt;a June 2017 episode of Econtalk &lt;/a &gt;that featured Russ, Mike Munger, and Don Boudreaux, so you should too! For a graphic introduction to this idea, see &lt;a href="https://wonderfulloaf.org/" target="_blank"&gt;wonderfulloaf.org &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is the economy profitably thought of as a machine? Like the behavior of a natural system like a liquid or gas whose behavior can be described using simple laws and perhaps manipulated? As a garden? A rainforest? Are the unplanned results of mass economic activity always good?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Russ leans libertarian but has a nuanced view honed through over 600 episodes of Econtalk, where he's talked to economists of all stripes. Like Smith, Russ recognizes that wealth is not the only good, that the economy is not going to serve all human needs, and that government regulations and infrastructure can be helpful and even necessary.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We talk through what "invisible hand" really means, tariffs and trade policy for less-developed countries, dehumanizing labor, self-interest, how Adam Smith's picture in &lt;em &gt;The Wealth of Nations &lt;/em &gt;relates to his account of moral judgments in &lt;em &gt;The Theory of Moral Sentiments &lt;/em &gt;(discussed on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/product/ep-45-moral-sense-theory-hume-and-smith/" target="_blank"&gt;PEL &lt;/a &gt;and at great length on &lt;a href="http://www.econlib.org/cgi-bin/fullsearch.pl?query=Klein%20Adam%20Smith" target="_blank"&gt;Econtalk &lt;/a &gt;), how to induce changes in popular mores, and whether Smith's moral concepts can handle the progressive character of morality (e.g., how people figured out over time that slavery was bad).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;To learn more about some of the topic discussed, listen to these episodes of PEL:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/09/07/ep123-1-economics/" target="_blank"&gt;Ep. 123: Economics with Hayek and Sen &lt;/a &gt;, featuring Hayek's 1945 paper, "The Use of Knowledge in Society"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/07/26/ep98-michael-sandel/" target="_blank"&gt;Ep. 98: Michael Sandel Against Market Society &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/10/10/ep83-frithjof-bergmann/" target="_blank"&gt;Ep. 83: New Work with Frithjof Bergmann &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/10/24/ep150-1-peter-singer/" target="_blank"&gt;Ep. 150: Peter Singer on Famine, Affluence, and Morality &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;...And these additional episodes of Econtalk:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/08/tyler_cowen_on_2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Aug. 2017: Tyler Cowen on Stubborn Attachments, Prosperity, and the Good Society &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2010/02/roberts_on_smit.html" target="_blank"&gt;Feb. 2010: Roberts on Smith, Ricardo, and Trade &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/01/roberts_and_han.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jan. 2009: Roberts (and Hanson) on Truth and Economics &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2011/06/munger_on_excha.html" target="_blank"&gt;June 2011: Munger on Exchange, Exploitation and Euvoluntary Transactions &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/10/tim_oreilly_on_1.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oct. 2017: Tim O'Reilly on What's the Future &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/01/michael_munger_3.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jan. 2017: Mike Munger on the Basic Income Guarantee &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/10/jennifer_burns.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oct. 2017: Jennifer Burns on Ayn Rand and the Goddess of the Market &lt;/a &gt;, which is a good one for exploring Russ's philosophical origins and provides a nice balance to &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/07/01/ep78-ayn-rand/" target="_blank"&gt;PEL's Rand treatment &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/li &gt;&lt;/ul &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Needle Exchange" by Punchy; listen to singer/songwriter Fritz Beer interviewed on &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem2-fritz-beer-knuckle-draggin-to-and-fro/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music #2 &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Philip K. Dick's &lt;em &gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&lt;/em &gt;(1967) and the films &lt;em &gt;Blade Runner 2049 &lt;/em &gt;(2017) and &lt;em &gt;Blade Runner &lt;/em &gt;(1982).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes us human? &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F" target="_blank"&gt;Dick's novel &lt;/a &gt;about androids emphasized their lack of empathy, while the movie adaptations portrayed the "replicants" as plenty capable of emotion, but unjustly treated as servants or targets.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;All of these works are about a demonized "other" that is similar to humans but not granted "personhood." A bounty hunter ("blade runner," the term used for the movie, was actually taken from &lt;a href="http://ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bladerunner" target="_blank"&gt;an unrelated book &lt;/a &gt;) kills these outlaws and is supposed to feel no remorse. But what if he's an android himself? What if he doesn't know he's an android? Or what if he's attracted to the android? What if he finds himself feeling empathy for androids? What if he is assigned to kill an android that looks &lt;em &gt;just like &lt;/em &gt;the one he just had sex with? What if he's an android in love with a programmed hologram girl who has sex with another android that the hologram girl is (nearly) synchronizing her motions with? Dark humor and/or long, slow visual effect shots set to atmospheric music is what!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;kills these outlaws and is supposed to feel no remorse. But what if he's an android himself? What if he doesn't know he's an android? Or what if he's attracted to the android? What if he finds himself feeling empathy for androids? What if he is assigned to kill an android that looks &amp;lt;em &amp;gt;just like &amp;lt;/em &amp;gt; the one he just had sex with? What if he's an android in love with a programmed hologram girl who has sex with another android that the hologram girl is (nearly) synchronizing her motions with? Dark humor and/or long, slow visual effect shots set to atmospheric music is what!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One of the more interesting features of the book is the religion, Mercerism, that involves a) status and ritual attached to taking care of an animal (which are hard to obtain, as most were wiped out in World War Terminus), and b) having a technologically induced multi-users-feeling-each-other online trip up a Christlike Sisyphus's mountain. Both of these things are supposed to embody this ethic of empathy, but they may be more like social control à la &lt;em &gt;1984 &lt;/em &gt;lite. Or maybe not: the ubiquitous TV host "Buster Friendly" that best conveys the spectacle ends up being an android who has it out for Mercerism. Mercer himself (the guy climbing the hill with whom the people bond in the ritual) is both a self-admitted phony and an authentic divine intervenor as he appears to two characters at key moments in the book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As is often the case with thoughtful fiction, there's a tangled mass of themes thrown out there and not explored in any systematic philosophical way (in the book and the films), and you get the feeling that key philosophical questions are simply being written as answered according to how the author happens to devise the details of the situation. For example, there's no real reflection on the question of whether machines can actually think or self-reflect; they're simply given as fulfilling all the normal qualities of personhood apart from some emotional abnormalities. They're even made of biological material (so &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_naturalism" target="_blank"&gt;John Searle &lt;/a &gt;should be OK with them thinking). So the question is just, are humans justified in treating them poorly, given that many of those humans themselves act without empathy, without appropriate affect, without truly authentic motivations or an independently achieved real appreciation of life? Clearly, the answer is "no," but luckily there are more interesting things going on in the book and films beyond this simple implication of the depicted conception of humanity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;If you're accessing this after having already listened to part 1 on the public feed, jump right to the music queue at 43:30.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Wounds and Nihilism (Quantum Androids)," written for this episode by Tyler Hislop (feat.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the film &lt;em &gt;Vertigo &lt;/em &gt;by Alfred Hitchcock (1958) and articles analyzing it including Laura Mulvey's "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975) and Robin Wood's "Vertigo" (1965).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(film)" target="_blank"&gt;Vertigo &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;has received more scholarly analysis than perhaps any film in history, and the PEL foursome talk through its free-play with cinematic conventions, its themes, and the philosophical issues involved. It's a thriller/detective story about a man crippled by trauma associated with his fear of heights who falls in love with a mysterious woman he has been tasked with following and their increasingly crazy relationship.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;One key theme is the nature of love and lust: Is the messed up interplay depicted of this film simply an aberration, or does it show us some dark undercurrent essential to romance? According to Jacques Lacan, "there is no sexual relationship," meaning that sex doesn't really touch the "otherness" of the other person; we remain isolated, getting pleasure from flesh and from an image we have in mind. (This strange view is explained in more detail in &lt;a href="https://leonbrenner.com/2016/11/08/there-is-no-sexual-relationship/" target="_blank"&gt;this blog post &lt;/a &gt;by Leon Brenner.) Laura Mulvey describes the woman as made into an object, first by the protagonist's stalkery gaze, and later explicitly through a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(play)" target="_blank"&gt;Pygmalion-type &lt;/a &gt;re-shaping to meet an ideal of beauty. And of course, we as spectators of the movie are objectifying her as well, though Hitchcock plays with this by shifting the narrative persona to her at a key point. Is femininity as our culture defines it really an artificial creation of men, designed for their pleasure and not for the benefit of women?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Interpreting the film existentially, is the vertigo depicted here not just the quirk of a particular character, but some part of the human condition, like nausea for Sartre or anxiety for Heidegger? Robin Wood describes the protagonist as perpetually hanging over an abyss for the whole film... metaphorically, but even perhaps literally, given that it starts with him literally hanging from a ledge and never actually explains how he could possibly have been rescued. Are we, too, always one step away from falling off the firm-seeming but ultimately illusory grounding that society is designed to keep us staring at? Perhaps when we leave Plato's cave and depart from the norm, we don't see a changeless heaven, but a void of non-meaning.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9YLXU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000I9YLXU &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=9aa9c5eff0817ab48dadcce52eb8bb99" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the film &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oetPo5LCMHM" target="_blank"&gt;watch it online &lt;/a &gt;(note that you can &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WrOKBmsOw7I" target="_blank"&gt;watch it in its proper form on YouTube &lt;/a &gt;for $3).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here are the full citations for all the articles that we were supposed to have read, though only the Mulvey and the Wood came up by name in our discussion:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;ul &gt;&lt;li &gt;&lt;p &gt;Laura Mulvey: "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975) from &lt;em &gt;Film Theory and Criticism: Introductory Readings &lt;/em &gt;(Eds.

Put aside the question of whether such a being could in principle be conscious or self-conscious or have a soul or whatever. None of those are necessary for it to be capable, say, of developing and manufacturing a trillion nanobots which it could then use to remake the earth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Bostrom thinks that we can make some predictions about the motivations of such a being, whatever goals it's programmed to achieve, e.g. its goals will entail that it won't want those goals changed by us. This sets up challenges for us in advance to figure out ways to frame and implement motivational programming an A.I. &lt;em &gt;before &lt;/em &gt;it's smart enough to resist future changes. Can we in effect tell the A.I. to figure out and do whatever we would ask it to do if we were better informed and wiser? Can we offload philosophical thought to such a superior intelligence in this way? Bostrom thinks that philosophers are in a great position for well-informed speculation on topics like this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Dylan, and Nick are also joined by &lt;a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=1911" target="_blank"&gt;former philosophy podcaster &lt;/a &gt;Luke Muehlhauser. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/12/25/topic-for-108-dangers-of-a-i-with-guest-nick-bostrom/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more &lt;/a &gt;about the topic and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199678111 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=HBW2C5CU6SVPBEDU" target="_blank"&gt;get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Volcano," by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Linsenmayer &lt;/a &gt;, recorded in 1992 and released on the album &lt;em &gt;Spanish Armada: Songs of Love and Related Neuroses &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Bostrom picture is by &lt;a href="http://www.genevievearnold.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Genevieve Arnold &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 1/6/15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Friedrich Nietzsche's &lt;em &gt;The Birth of Tragedy &lt;/em &gt;(1872), which was his first book.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the connection between art and society? Nietzsche thought that you could tell how vital or decadent a civilization was by its art, and said that ancient Greek tragedy (like &lt;em &gt;Antigone &lt;/em &gt;) was so great because it was a perfect synthesis of something highly formal/orderly/beautiful with the intuitive/unconscious/chaotic. He calls these two elements the Apollonian and the Dionysian and gives a whole history of the rise and fall of ancient Greece as seen through their art. They were noble savages, but channeled their savagery in a way that formed what Nietzsche later called master morality. Whereas later, playwrights like Euripides lost touch with the chaotic side, really lost sight of themselves, and this was reflected in Western philosophy and later science from Socrates to the present. Can we stir the pot now to get a re-birth of tragedy in this awesome sense? Nietzsche was ultimately not optimistic.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The full four are rejoined by drama guy John Castro. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/07/04/topic-119-nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about it and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why write songs? What is it to have "integrity" as a musician? To be "authentic?" Is there anything wrong with playing pure pop songs, or aping styles created by those now dead? Our guests &lt;a href="http://www.victorkrummenacher.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Victor Krummenacher &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.jonathansegel.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Segel &lt;/a &gt;(of the famed indie band &lt;a href="http://campervanbeethoven.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Camper van Beethoven &lt;/a &gt;) have a beef with the Internet society where music and other trappings of identity are now available without effort and often without cost. Your favored music speaks for you, and you in turn mirror it, but how can this work if the music is somehow fake, or if you are? Or is this concern with authenticity simply misguided?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Wes pioneer a new PEL era in interviewing rock stars without a text. However, &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/06/19/topic-118-music-camper-van-beethoven/" target="_blank"&gt;look here &lt;/a &gt;for our agreed-up on list of topics and links to songs/videos/blog posts we all looked at before the discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This was the episode that prefigured Mark's &lt;a href="http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nakedly Examined Music podcast &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can hear the Aftershow &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50275668" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, where a bunch of musicians including another Camper, Chris Molla, continued the conversation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "The Bastards Never Show Themselves" by &lt;a href="http://www.monksofdoom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Monks of Doom &lt;/a &gt;from their upcoming album &lt;em &gt;The Bronte Pin &lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;About that ancient Greek tragedy (441 BCE)... What can we learn from it? Are its literary tropes and ethical conflicts so far removed from us that the best we can do is marvel at it? Heck, no! Classic literature is great fodder for philosophical discussion, and the doings of the play can be fruitfully related to our modern troubles with ethics and the state. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan were rejoined by drama guy John Castro, who played Haimon in &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50234760" target="_blank"&gt;our performance &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/06/06/topic117-sophocles-antigone/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic, and get the text &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50235015" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the Aftershow &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Woe Is Me," performed live by &lt;a href="http://www.marklint.com/madisonlint.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Madison Lint &lt;/a &gt;on Madison's WORT, 6/28/02 &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 6/13/15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;As a study aid for our episode 117, here's an unrehearsed, dramatic read-through of the text we'll be discussing, a Greek tragedy written around 441 BCE, telling the myth of the cursed line of Oedipus, mother-f*#king king of Thebes. It features Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan, plus special guest starts Lucy Lawless as Antigone, Paul Provenza as Creon, Alice Sinclair as Ismene, and John Castro as Haimon.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;After the performance, the cast discusses the conventions of Greek tragedy, our selected translation, and a little about why philosophers should be interested in this. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/06/06/topic117-sophocles-antigone/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text to read along &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50234874" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to our discussion of the play &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This Citizen Edition features an extra six minutes or so at the end of the discussion, with some enthusiasm about Shakespeare and our possible future plans to perform one of his works. And after the song, a few amusing outtakes from the performance.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Antigone (Choragos Speaks)" by Mark Lint. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/06/07/antigone-theme/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Antigone image by &lt;a href="http://www.genevievearnold.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Genevieve Arnold &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Sigmund Freud's &lt;em &gt;On Dreams &lt;/em &gt;(1902), a bit of &lt;em &gt;The Interpretation of Dreams &lt;/em &gt;(1899), and the lecture, “Revision of the Theory of Dreams” (1933).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are dreams just a bunch of random crap? Freud says, no, they're actually the first and best way to figure out the structure of the mind, which (surprise) involves the unconscious and how repressed, anti-social desires get (sort of) revealed to us, albeit smashed together through chains of association with what seems like random crap.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How can Freud support such a view? Is it science? What are its implications for our capacity to philosophize? Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan are here to sort of hint at telling you, but in a repressed sort of way. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/05/23/topic116-freud-dreams/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the texts &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50234563" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the aftershow with Wes and host Danny Lobell &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Sleep" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/05/24/sleep/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Freud image by &lt;a href="http://sterlingbartlett.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sterling Bartlett &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 5/23/15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Arthur Schopenhauer's &lt;em &gt;The World As Will and Representation &lt;/em &gt;(1818), vol. 1, book 3, sections 34, 38-39, 40, 45, and focusing on 51 and 52, plus chapters 34 and 39 from vol. 3 (1844). This continues &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/04/27/ep114-schopenhauer-will/" target="_blank"&gt;our previous discussion &lt;/a &gt;of book 2 and the beginning of book 3.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is music just pleasing, structured sound? Schopenhauer thinks it's much more than that: it's our way of experiencing Will itself, the striving that underlies and unifies the universe. But oddly, the only way to really enjoy it or any other art (at least in the manner S. approves of, which does not involve "boogying") is to in some sense leave our personal strivings behind and enter a state of will-less contemplation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan are joined by &lt;a href="http://www.jonathansegel.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Segel &lt;/a &gt;(from the band Camper Van Beethoven) to discuss the beautiful (good!), the charming (bad!), the sublime (scary, but extra good), how music differs from the representational arts (it's better), how music does or doesn't go with words and images, and what Platonic Ideas have to do with all of this. And did you know that cellos are vegetables? You did not. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/05/08/topic115-schopenhauer-music/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the readings &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Arthur Schopenhauer's &lt;em &gt;The World As Will and Representation &lt;/em &gt;(1818), book 2.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Sure, we know from our senses and science what the world looks like to creatures like us, but if you buy Kant's view that this "world as appearance" is a construct of our minds, what's the reality behind the appearance?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Schopenhauer thinks that we can know this: The world is what he calls "Will," because just like know what it's like to be you from the inside (you don't just see your body move but know what it is to will that body to move), the rest of the world has a comparable inside, and it's that inside that explains all the striving that we see around us, whether it's plants growing toward the sun, animals acting on instinct, or physical objects following laws of motion and gravity.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;So in a sense, everything is alive, and moreover, it's all the SAME living thing: a massive, singular Will that exists outside space, time, and the causal chain: It's a whole different thing than anything we perceive through the senses, yet all those perceived things are somehow manifestations of this Will. It's like the Force, except blind and futile.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;That amounts to some highly chewy metaphysics for the regular four to slobber over. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/04/24/topic114-schopenhauer-will/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/05/06/schopenhauer-aftershow/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the Aftershow with Danny Lobell and Seth Paskin.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Sinking” from &lt;a href="http://www.marklint.com/samples.html#sinking" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &amp;amp; the Simulacra &lt;/a &gt;, recorded in 2000, mixed just now.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Drawing on John Dominic Crossan's &lt;em &gt;The Power of Parable &lt;/em &gt;, mainly ch. 3 (2012), Paul Ricoeur's "Listening to the Parables of Jesus" (1974), and Paul Tillich's &lt;em &gt;The New Being &lt;/em &gt;, ch. 1: "To Whom Much Is Forgiven..." (1955).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are these weird stories riddles, where if you figure out what they mean you get salvation? Are they homilies, telling you to go be like the Good Samaritan? Crossan says they're protests, meant to challenge the moral and social status quo. So what do philosophers have to gain by studying these? What do they add to moral theory, and do you have to have any religious commitments to get something out of them? Mark, Wes, and returning guest Law Ware talk through the various ways of interpreting the Good Samaritan, The Sower, The Two Debtors, The Talents, the Hidden Treasure, the Ten Virgins, the Three Amigos, and more. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/03/19/topic113-jesus-parables/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the books &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: A new recording of a song written (apart from the first couple of bars) for this episode, "Jesus Noise," by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/04/05/jesus-noise/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/04/21/two-biblical-aftershows-now-available-for-inspiration/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the Aftershow on this episode.&lt;/a &gt;Citizens can also listen to &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/05/07/bonus-recording-the-historical-jesus/" target="_blank"&gt;the bonus discussion on the Historical Jesus &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Jesus picture by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 4/6/15.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

For Ricoeur, it's a two-way street: We need to change our understanding of the text (i.e. read it historically, recognizing for example that it was common to mythologize heroes in texts at the time), but also "put at risk" our own evaluative presuppositions, which under the tutelage of science have blinded us to symbolism and so left us unable to even sensibly ask the question "what is it to be saved?"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The regular four are joined by &lt;a href="http://philosophy.okstate.edu/index.php?option=com_content &amp;amp;view=article &amp;amp;id=124:lawrence-ware" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Ware &lt;/a &gt;to figure out what this "hermeneutics of suspicion" is all about. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/03/13/topic112-ricoeur/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the essays &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/04/21/two-biblical-aftershows-now-available-for-inspiration/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the Aftershow on this episode.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: A live performance (recorded via camcorder) by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/fake.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint and the Fake &lt;/a &gt;from Dec.

We can't just put aside our prejudices to get to such an objective truth, and in fact without the baggage we bring to a text, we have no purchase from which to begin an interpretation.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan try to get through all this rich material, discussing science vs. philosophy (again!), modern art, what it is to be practical, and lots more. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/02/16/topic111-gadamer-hermeneutics/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the texts &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/03/22/listen-to-the-gadamer-aftershow/" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the Aftershow with Stephen West and Seth Paskin &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "The Default Relation," a new song by Mark Lint. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/03/02/default-relation/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Gadamer picture is by &lt;a href="http://www.instagram.com/sterlingbartlett" target="_blank"&gt;Sterling Bartlett &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 3/2/15 &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Concept of Nature &lt;/em &gt;(1920).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Whitehead thinks that old-timey metaphysics wrongly insists that what's fundamental in the world to be studied by science is things (substance) moving around in space and time. We don't actually experience any such thing as "substance," so on this view we end up with an uncrossable gap between the world of our experience and that of science. Whitehead wants us to start instead with what we experience, which is events, and figure out how to abstract from those to come up with time, space, objects, and motion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;By getting rid of a pre-existent space-time grid, he also thinks his way of describing nature will accord better with relativity theory, since he allows for multiple space-time frameworks. His explanation involves a lot of tortured 4-dimensional geometry and heaps of weirdly defined terms, but the regular four podcasters are mighty &lt;em &gt;events &lt;/em &gt;(not mere people), and we will soldier on to Cleopatra's Needle and beyond!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This will all be clearer to you if you &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50228008" target="_blank"&gt;listen to Mark's introduction &lt;/a &gt;, then you can &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/01/20/topic110-whitehead/" target="_blank"&gt;read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.

What about religion? Jaspers thinks that science gives you facts, but for an overarching world-view, you need philosophy. Living such a world-view requires Existenz, or a leap towards transcendence, which is of course religion's stock and trade, though Jaspers is not a fan of dogmatism (or of giving definitions for his basic terms).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Seth got to go hang at the Provenza mansion and hooked up with Mark, Wes, and Dylan for an especially lively session covering the different flavors of existentialism, freedom, Jaspers vs. Heidegger, philosophical comedy, how existentialism just ripped off Buddhism, and Seth's visit to not-a-strip-club.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/50227571" target="_blank"&gt;listen to Mark's introduction &lt;/a &gt;, then &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/01/05/topic109-karl-jaspers-existentialism/" target="_blank"&gt;read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.

Burke says yes: they're rooted in our common reactions to pain and pleasure, those two are not opposites, but simply quite different properties, each associated with a different set of responses. When we are aesthetically pleased by something big, indistinct, and maybe scary, Burke calls that a judgment that it's sublime.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, and Dylan are joined by guest &lt;a href="http://www.amirzaki.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Amir Zaki &lt;/a &gt;to wander the through the field of ideas of this slim, rich, and breezy text.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Immanuel Kant's &lt;em &gt;Critique of Judgment &lt;/em &gt;(1790), Pt. 1, Book 1.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Kant thinks that finding something beautiful is different than merely liking it. It's a certain kind of liking, not dependent on your idiosyncratic tastes (like your preference for one color or flavor or tone over another) or on your moral opinions. He wants these judgments to be subjective in the sense that they're not about the object, but about the fact that people receive pleasure from it, yet he also wants them to be universal, so that if I (correctly) find something beautiful, then I expect others to feel the same way, and moreover, if they have taste, they should.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Of course this is all put into very difficult Kantian language with virtually no actual examples, so the regular foursome had a good time attempting to translate it to something you can get your head around. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/11/07/topic-105-kant-beauty/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Cool Down" from &lt;em &gt;Mark Lint &amp;amp; the Fake Johnson Trio &lt;/em &gt;(1998), newly resung and remixed. &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/FJTalbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Download the album &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Guest: Slate's Stephen Metcalf.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What moral limits should we put on government power? Nozick thinks that the only legitimate functions of government are protection and enforcement of contracts. Contra Rawls, Nozick's "entitlement" version of justice doesn't look at income inequality or any other pattern of holdings, but only at whether holdings were legitimately obtained, e.g. through purchase, gift, inheritance, reparation, or taking something unclaimed. Of course, since our current distribution of wealth has its historical roots deep in war and pillaging...

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Henry David Thoreau's &lt;em &gt;Walden &lt;/em &gt;(1854).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the appropriate life for a truly thoughtful person? Thoreau warns against getting ensnared by social bullshit like jobs and charity, and instead living simply, in direct contact with nature, relying as much as possible only on your own effort. His time in the woods on Walden pond was meant to be an experiment to see what life lived this way really has to offer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan argue about how to best take Thoreau's brand of opinionating, and what the ethical upshot of the attempt to live naturally is supposed to be. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/10/07/topics-for-103-104-thoreau-and-nozick/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Green Song" by Mark Linsenmayer, originally released on &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://marklint.com/MayTricksAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;The MayTricks &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1992), newly remixed. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/10/13/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-green-song-and-idiot-listen/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ralph Waldo Emerson's "The American Scholar" lecture (1837) and his essays "Self-Reliance" and "Circles" (1841).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How should we live? Emerson thinks that conformity, which includes most of what passes for ethics, jobs, and scholarship, makes us less than truly human. Be true to yourself! But since we're all ever-changing, that's a moving target, right? But Emerson thinks that when you get really truly honest about what you think and feel, it turns out that you've tapped into something universal, something beyond just you, something eternal.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;But don't expect Emerson to really explain that part; the upshot of these essays is primarily social, not religious, much less metaphysical. Trust yourself, stop bullshitting, stop living according to others' expectations! Mark, Wes, and Dylan argue over whether this is tired cliche or acutely perceptive, and whether Emerson's poetic language provides helps or distracts. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/09/04/topic102-emerson/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the essays &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Idiot, Listen" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;, recorded mostly in 1997, newly (in 2014) completed and mixed.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The picture is by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;for PEL.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Guide for the Perplexed &lt;/em &gt;(1168).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is God? Central to Judaism, at least, is the idea that He's a unity: "God is One." Maimonides thinks that this means you can't attribute properties to God at all. Why? Because (according to M's Aristotelian metaphysics, anyway) size, color, spatial and temporal location, mental state, etc. are really parts of a thing. Unity = no parts = no properties, not even essential properties, i.e. those that define a thing. So God has no definition, and all the statements about God (He's good, he's all-powerful, omniscient, etc.) central to religion are strictly speaking false. You can only say what God is &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Seth are joined by Danny Lobell, comedian host of the &lt;a href="http://www.moderndayphilosophers.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Modern Day Philosophers &lt;/a &gt;podcast to figure out what this could possibly amount to. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/08/11/topic101-maimonides/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Double Negative Theology" by Mark Lint. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/09/01/double-negative-theology/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The picture is by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;for PEL.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, Dylan, and Philosophy Bro walk a live audience through Plato's dialogue about love, sex, self-improvement, and ancient Greek pederasty. You can also choose to &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/UmA0yG2Am5A" target="_blank"&gt;watch this on video &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is love just a feeling, or does it make the world go 'round? Does love make you better, or make you weak? What's the difference between good love and bad love (and is any love bad)? Plato gives us a whole panel of related but conflicting opinions through the mouths of his characters here, including not only Socrates and his predictable "when you love in the right way, you're really loving the good itself," but comedic playwright Aristophanes (love completes us, literally!), mooning Athenian statesman Alcibiades, and a bunch of other historical figures who are to varying degrees fixated on teenage boys.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The big show, recorded 7/20/14 in Middleton, WI, in front of an audience of PEL fans who traveled in to see us, starts off with a tune from &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;featuring Rei Tangko, followed by &lt;a href="http://www.philosophybro.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy Bro &lt;/a &gt;doing his magic thing to give you background on Plato's "Apology" (which you should recall from &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/05/12/part-1-of-episode-1-the-unexamined-life-is-not-worth-living/" target="_blank"&gt;our first episode &lt;/a &gt;), then the main event, followed by some Q &amp;amp;A from audience members and Daniel Horne reading webcam viewer comments. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/07/18/topics-for-97-100/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Mark Lint tunes here are "Nothing in This World But You," then (bumped to the end of this recording), "Feeling Time," "Find You Out," "Adds Up to Nothing," "Granted," and "I Demand It."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This picture of Plato is by Genevieve Arnold for PEL.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

In other words, on this view, you are in your essence just a choosing being, not a member of your family or community. Sandel thinks that is bunk. It doesn't allow for real introspection, or even real freedom, as all of our choices would merely be based on ultimately arbitrary preferences, and not on understanding who we really are.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan debate whether Sandel is really representing Rawls's liberalism fairly here and what alternative to a liberal state he's actually suggesting. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/07/18/topics-for-97-100/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about it and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Lynda Walsh's book &lt;em &gt;Scientists as Prophets: A Rhetorical Genealogy &lt;/em &gt;(2013) with the author, focusing on Robert J. Oppenheimer. We also read a speech from 1950 he gave called "The Encouragement of Science." Lynda starts us off with a brief introduction.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the role of the science adviser? Should scientists just "stick to the facts," or can only someone with technical knowledge make decisions about what to actually do? After leading the atomic bomb project during WWII, Oppenheimer thought that scientists needed to become politicians themselves to make sure that the power of technology wasn't abused. His views about openness (sharing weapons tech with other governments) didn't go over well with the Eisenhower administration, and he was stripped of his security clearance.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lynda's book is not philosophy, exactly, but about rhetoric. Her thesis is that the social role of preacher-scientists like Oppenheimer is comparable to that of ancient prophets like the Oracle at Delphi: they serve to bring about political certainty by providing knowledge inaccessible to ordinary citizens. Insofar as we can't ourselves analyze the data, we're taking them on faith as authorities.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Lynda tries to get Mark, Seth, and Dylan to talk about the difference between philosophy and rhetoric. There's some talk of Bill Nye, Neil Degrasse-Tyson, Rachael Carson, Stephen Jay Gould, and others. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/06/26/topic96-oppenheimer/" target="_blank"&gt;Get more information about the topic, as well as Lynda's book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Request Denied," by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;, recorded in spurts between 2000 and 2014.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;for the picture of Oppenheimer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Kurt Gödel's essays, “Some Basic Theorems on the Foundations of Mathematics and their Implications” (1951) and “The Modern Development of the Foundations of Mathematics in Light of Philosophy” (1961). This starts with a brief introduction from our guest  Adi Habbu.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Gödel is famous for some "incompleteness theorems" of direct interest only to those trying to axiomatize mathematics. What are the implications for the rest of philosophy? Gödel thought that, contra people's claims that incompleteness demonstrates some kind of relativism, he had showed that the world of mathematics even in its most abstract reaches is part of the real (though non-physical) world. Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Adi try to figure out these unpublished and dare I say incomplete essays.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/06/07/topic-for-95-godel-on-math/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic, and get the essays &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Axiomatic" from Mark Lint &amp;amp; the Simulacra. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/06/14/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Arthur Schopenhauer's essays, "On Authorship and Style," "On Thinking for Oneself," and "On Genius" (all published 1851).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is the best way to do philosophy (or any art) to self-consciously build on the work of others to advance the genre? Schopenhauer says no! Geniuses are solitary, original, authentic, naive thinkers. They write because they have something to say, not because they're being paid. They don't read too much for fear of being overwhelmed by their influences, and certainly don't try to remember what they read too well like a scholar would. They think before writing, and get at perennial truths from their own, uniquely grown perspective. So don't burden them with responsibilities like jobs and families, okay?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, and Dylan try to figure out whether these harsh commandments hold water or whether S. is just giving excuses for his own unpopularity. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/05/11/topic94-schopenhauer/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about it and get the essays &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Drake's Song" from &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://marklint.com/maytrick.html" target="_blank"&gt;The MayTricks &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1992) (chords: Brian Drake, lyrics/melody: Mark) &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/MayTricksAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Get the whole album free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Galen Strawson says no: our choices stem from our character, which is not something we chose (or if we did choose a path to having that character, that prior choice wasn't the result of another choice, etc.). Galen's father P.F. Strawson said that blame and resentment are essential parts of our social attitudes and aren't really open to philosophical critique, no matter what you think about determinism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Tamler tries to convince Mark, Wes, and Seth that ole' P.F. was right.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Outlines of Pyrrhonism &lt;/em &gt;, Book 1, from around 200 CE. With guest Jessica Berry.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are our beliefs warranted? Skeptics following in the footsteps of Pyrrho (who lived just after Aristotle, around 300 BCE, but didn't leave us any writings, so Sextus, centuries later, has to fill us in) thought that for any argument someone puts forward (at least about the nature of reality), you can come up with a plausible counter-argument, and that after you've done this enough, you achieve a relaxed state where you you're satisfied in not being able to decide.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is this really true? And is there a sharp distinction between beliefs you need to accept in order to live (this is food; that is poison) and theoretical ones? Can a philosopher really get beyond philosophizing in this way? Can one be a scientist and still be a skeptic of this sort? &lt;a href="http://philosophy.gsu.edu/profile/jessica-berry/" target="_blank"&gt;Jessica Berry &lt;/a &gt;joins Mark, Wes, and Dylan to defend this position. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/11/26/topic-for-106-ancient-greek-skepticism-according-to-sextus-empiricus/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Point of Confusion" recorded for this episode by &lt;a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/12/04/ep106-pyrrhonian-skepticism-citizen/marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/12/02/point-of-confusion/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Pyrrho picture is by &lt;a href="http://existentialcomics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corey Mohler &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Originally published 11/15/14.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

While Kant had dismissed metaphysics as groundless speculation about things beyond human knowledge, Bergson sees it as a matter of grasping things "from the inside." He calls this "intuition": the kind of understanding we have of our own inner lives. If you try to describe this with concepts or images, you falsify it, you freeze it into position. That's necessarily what science does, and is very useful, but doesn't get at what's metaphysically fundamental for Bergson, which is the unbroken flow of duration.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The regular foursome and &lt;a href="http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/elucidations/" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Teichman &lt;/a &gt;try to figure out how this proto-phenomenology is supposed to actually amount to metaphysics, like how you can sympathetically have an intuition about anything besides your own experience.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/03/04/henri-bergson/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "I Recall" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html#sinking" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &amp;amp; the Simulacra &lt;/a &gt;(recorded mostly in 2000, completed in 2014).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing David Brin’s novel Existence (2012) with the author. Also with guest Brian Casey.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing David Brin's novel &lt;em &gt;Existence &lt;/em &gt;(2012) with the author, with an opening salvo pre-recorded by Mark. Also featuring Dylan's brother, Brian Casey.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the point of thinking? Brin sees the future as a pressing threat, and &lt;em &gt;Existence &lt;/em &gt;speculates that the reason we don't see evidence of life on other planets is that no species survives its technological adolescence. The solution? We need to be smarter than our parents and work to give our kids the tools to be smarter than we are. In the book, the ultimate hope comes from a concerted effort to develop and diversify the coalition of Earth's intelligent life, to make "humanity" encompass more than just the biological humans that we currently are.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In our present political difficulties, Brin sees the solution as positive-sum games: institutions like science and markets that (are supposed to) result in everybody benefiting overall. We need to keep elites (whether corporate or governmental) from screwing these games up, and to use technology to foster reciprocal accountability. The government is illicitly spying on people? Spy back and call them out when power is abused! Instead of vainly trying to hold back technology, just make sure that it's not restricted to elites, that there can be effective debate re. its uses.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The point of thinking for Brin is to "be a good ancestor." Philosophy and science fiction can help through thought experiments that visualize the outcomes of our ideas and can help in developing scientific theories.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Bishop George Berkeley’s &lt;em &gt;Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous &lt;/em &gt;(1713).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;While only a goon would deny the real existence of things like tables and chairs, does "real" existence have to mean existence as matter, i.e. as something that could exist in the absence of any mind to think about it? Berkeley says no! Tables and chairs are ideas! But not just &lt;em &gt;my &lt;/em &gt;ideas, or yours, as they obviously don't disappear when we leave the room, and certainly trees and the like were around before people. So they're God's ideas! And hey, this chain of reasoning actually provides a proof for God's existence! Sweet!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Wes tries to convince Mark and Dylan that this is actually compelling, well argued, and motivated by deep philosophical concerns that were historically central and still relevant today. Wes provides a lengthy introduction before we have the discussion.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Elizabeth Anscombe’s “Modern Moral Philosophy” (1958), "Intention" sections 22-27 (1957), and “War and Murder” (1961).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Elizabeth Anscombe's "Modern Moral Philosophy" (1958), &lt;em &gt;Intention &lt;/em &gt;sections 22-27 (1957), and "War and Murder" (1961).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Anscombe thinks that our moral language was developed in a theistic context, and without a law-giver, the idea of a moral law or obligation doesn't make sense. However, we can debate about what actions display "justice," whether some action is "harmful," whether some task was performed "well," etc. There are lots of evaluative words that have established social contexts and can be used unproblematically, but they can't be added up into some overall judgement that "This is good! You must do it!" ...at least not without a lot of work into figuring out what constitutes human flourishing.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What she writes beyond that depends on her audience: In a Catholic journal, she has no problem doing ethics: Are we ever justified in killing innocents? Or in going to war? For her fellow analytic philosophers, she instead writes about how best to talk about our actions: Given that a particular action in a particular situation can be given innumerable descriptions, how do these all relate to each other? This, however is still relevant to ethics, in that we need to figure out how to talk about the intentions involved in an action in order to assess its morality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Join Mark, Wes, Dylan, and special guest &lt;a href="http://www.philosophybro.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Philosophy Bro &lt;/a &gt;as we discuss how "why" relates to "how," whether Anscombe has really overcome Hume's is-ought gap, and coitus reservatus. But first, &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/01/18/precognition-88-anscombe/" target="_blank"&gt;listen to Bro's Introduction to Anscombe &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2014/01/23/topic-for-88-g-e-m-anscombe-on-ethical-judgment-and-action/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the texts &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Adds Up to Nothing," a brand new (2014) song by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Typically, we avoid video in the hope of lessening bandwidth problems, and besides which, if you, the end user can't see us, why add that layer of communication on our end? It ended up making it much more fun for me, though a bit nerve-wracking in that I had not prepped to be seen. I did feel like some of my dramatic pauses would have made more sense if you could see the gestures I was making at my fellow-players, but oh, well.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;-Mark Linsenmayer &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Jean-Paul Sartre’s “Existentialism is a Humanism” (1946), “Bad Faith” (1943), and his play No Exit (1944).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Jean-Paul Sartre's "Existentialism is a Humanism" (1946), "Bad Faith" (pt. 1, ch. 2 of &lt;em &gt;Being &amp;amp; Nothingness &lt;/em &gt;, 1943), and his play &lt;em &gt;No Exit &lt;/em &gt;(1944). This recording starts off with an introduction by Mark Linsenmayer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is human nature? Sartre says that there isn't one, but there is a universal human condition, which is our absolute freedom. This freedom is a basic certainty in our experience, and it comes out of the mere fact of our being able to will, so no subsequent alleged science can contradict it. If you claim to be determined by your character or circumstances, you're acting in "bad faith," which is what for Sartre has to serve as an ethics given the lack of good and evil floating out there in the world or duties assigned to us by nature or God or any of that. He describes his project as a matter of teasing out the often unrealized implications atheism.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Though his reading is rife with fun, literary examples, we (the regular foursome) had trouble both with this insistence on absolute freedom in all circumstances and on on this claim about no human nature which ends up making bad faith seemingly inevitable: you can't be "authentic" to your "true self" because there is no true self to be authentic to!

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Friedrich Nietzsche's &lt;em &gt;The Gay Science &lt;/em &gt;(1882, with book 5 added 1887).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is wisdom? Nietzsche gives us an updated take on the Socratic project of challenging your most deeply held beliefs. Challenge not just your belief in God ("God is dead!") but uncover all your habits of thinking in terms of the divine. Question the motives behind relentless inquiry: the "will to truth." Realize how little of your life is actually a matter of conscious reflection, and the consequent limits on self-knowledge. The very act of systematization in philosophy overestimates what we can know; instead, we need a "gay" (in the sense of cheerful, carefree, and subversive) science (in the sense of organized knowledge; this is not about modern experimental science) that chases after fleeting insights and is able to question, i.e. laugh at, the pretensions of its own activity. This is the position from which one can then artistically create one's own character and one's values, and this "creation" is not whimsical in the sense of arbitrary, but is a matter of rigorous and careful discernment, an exercise of one's "intellectual conscience." Hear Mark, Wes, and Dylan frolic through this field of aphorisms and short essays.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/10/10/topic84nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic, find out exactly which sections we read, and get the text.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Take a Hike," by Mark Lint and Stevie P. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/11/11/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-take-a-hike/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;More details about the post-work world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In light of our ep. 83, many listeners had questions on Frithjof's social/political/economic proposals for creating a post-job, pro-meaningful-work world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark Linsenmayer here pitches a number of these questions (culled from &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/10/17/submit-your-questions-for-the-frithjof-bergmann-qa/" target="_blank"&gt;our blog &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/partiallyexaminedlife/permalink/10151911399159660/" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook group &lt;/a &gt;) to Frithjof. What would a future New Work world look like? How do first-world folks fit into the project? How can I make MY calling economically work RIGHT NOW? What does New Work require for education?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Conjectures and Refutations &lt;/em &gt;(1963), the first three essays, starting off with an introduction by Dylan Casey.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is science, and how is it different than pseudo-science? From philosophy? Is philosophy just pseudo-science, or proto-science, or what? Popper thinks that all legitimate inquiry is about solving real problems, and scientific theories are those that are potentially falsifiable: they make definitely predictions about the world that, if these fail to be true, would show that the theory is false.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;With this idea, Popper thinks he's achieved a real respect for objectivity and beaten the epistemologists of the past, both empiricists (who think the ultimate source of knowledge is experience) and rationalists (who think that it's reason). For Popper, there is no such infallible source. We approach nature with expectations: we leap to a theory with little if any warrant (the "conjectures") and then we modify it when it fails us ("refutations"). Modify, not reject: really, the most powerful force in knowledge is tradition, so long as that tradition is open to critique.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/08/28/topic82-popper/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Falsifiable," by Mark Lint, written and recorded just for this episode. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/09/24/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-falsifiable/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Carl Jung's "Approaching the Unconscious" from &lt;em &gt;Man and His Symbols &lt;/em &gt;, written in 1961, starting off with an introduction by Wes Alwan.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the structure of the mind? Jung followed Freud in positing an unconscious distinct from the conscious ego, but Jung's picture has the unconscious much more stuffed full of all sorts of stuff from who knows where, including instincts (the archetypes) that tend to give rise to behavior and dream imagery that we'd have to call religious. We neglect this part of ourselves at our psychological peril, and Jung also attributes the ills of the age (like nihilism and WWII) to being out of touch with our larger, unconscious selves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Sound like goofy pop psychology? Well, Jung's book was written specifically for the populace, and many have run with his emphasis on spiritual self-knowledge and his openness to talk of the paranormal to conclusions less well founded than Jung would have liked. Mark, Seth, and Wes keep trying to make the text speak to other philosophical works but eventually get sidetracked and occasionally personal on this &lt;em &gt;very special episode &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/07/29/topic81-jung/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Bedlam" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint and the Simulacra.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/08/29/bedlam/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Martin Heidegger's "Letter on Humanism" (1949), starting off with an introduction by Seth Paskin.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Martin Heidegger's "Letter on Humanism" (1949), starting off with a short summary of the reading by Seth Paskin.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's our place in the world? What is it, really, to be human? Heidegger thought that being human hinges on having a proper relationship to Being. What is Being? Well, it's something more basic than particular beings like people and tables and such, yet it being so close, Heidegger thinks it's hardest to see, and that we too often get sucked exclusively into engagement with particular beings: into worldly goals and temptations.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;He wrote this essay as a response to a question about whether his philosophy was a type of humanism, meaning an ethics based on relieving suffering and other evidently human interests. He responds that humanism is based on bad metaphysics that ignores Being in favor of beings, and it's in fact that humanistic viewpoint that enables so much inhumanity in the first place. If you'd just get right with Being, you'd have wisdom and ethics and the rest of it would come naturally to you. But of course, most of us won't do that, because we're too corrupted by modern society and philosophical history starting with Plato to even understand what in blazes he's talking about.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Eva Brann discusses her book &lt;em &gt;The Logos of Heraclitus &lt;/em &gt;(2011).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the world like, and how can we understand it? Heraclitus thinks that the answer to both questions is found in "the logos," which is a Greek word with multiple meanings: it can be an explanation, a word or linguistic meaning, science, rationality (the Latin word is "ratio"), the principle of exchange between things... So the world is logos, in that it behaves in a lawlike manner so that mathematics and science can describe it. His physics imagined a basic material (he calls it fire, but clearly doesn't mean the same thing as ordinary, visible fire) that transforms in lawlike ways (in definite ratios) into all the different parts of the world, and that it's these cycles of transformation, driven by the logos itself, that make the world the moving system it is.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The world's intelligibility--its singular logos--doesn't mean it's peaceful, though. The world is held together by tension; the logos is force. Confusingly to modern readers, Heraclitus believes that paradoxes really exist, that what in this discussion we call "stable ambivalences" hold, e.g. that relationships are made up of both love and strife, not in alternation but both, essentially, at the same time. Should this "logos" be thought of as God? Does it have a personality, a will? Is it immanent in the world or a transcendent force shaping the world? Heraclitus says that the logos "is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus." It's a stable ambivalence! Is your MIND BLOWN YET? &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/06/23/topic-for-79-heraclituss-metaphysics-of-tension-with-eva-brann/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Trading Away" by &lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New People &lt;/a &gt;, from &lt;em &gt;Impossible Things &lt;/em &gt;(2011), written by Matt Ackerman.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On John Rawls's &lt;em &gt;A Theory of Justice &lt;/em &gt;(1971), most of ch. 1-4, starting off with an introduction by Seth Paskin.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes for a just society? Rawls gives us a thought experiment: Imagine you don't know whether you're rich or poor or any of the other specifics of your situation (he calls this going behind "the veil of ignorance" into the "original position"). Now what principles would you pick to determine basic social institutions? Would you choose a caste society where you might be born an untouchable and be screwed? Rawls thinks that in this position you would instead support his basic rules of justice, which are (in short) to make sure everyone has basic liberties, and, more controversially, to allow only such inequalities as bring up the fortunes of those least well off. So you can allow super riches so long as doing so means that the poorest will be less poor than with any other arrangement; the default position is everyone getting an equal share of society's wealth unless you can demonstrate that letting some have more will benefit all.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This theory has been massively influential, and you can easily read it into Obama's speeches. Even many defenders of free-market capitalism do so on basically Rawlsian grounds. The founding fathers (Mark, Seth and Wes) and an especially energetic Dylan debate whether this original position is really coherent and whether it yields the principles that Rawls wants it to.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/11/10/topic85-rawls/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Yours to Keep," by Mark Lint &amp;amp; the Madison Lint Ensemble, featuring Bob Linsenmayer. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/12/06/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-yours-to-keep/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Then she uses this certainty to argue for her semi-Nietzschean vision of Great Men who master their emotions and rely only on themselves. Mark, Wes, Dylan, and Seth are satisfied with neither effort.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Warning: This attempt to make sense of Rand's texts will likely offend any Randians out there, and our reading numerous passages from her alleged "texts" may offend the rest of you. When in doubt, curl up in the fetal position and moan "A=A!" over and over again until the bad sounds stop.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Correction: The movie Atlas Shrugged actually got 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, with Part II getting 5%, both greater than L.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On George Santayana's The Sense of Beauty (1896). What are we saying when we call something "beautiful?"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;On George Santayana's &lt;em &gt;The Sense of Beauty &lt;/em &gt;(1896).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What are we saying when we call something "beautiful?" Are we pointing out an objective quality that other people (anyone?) can ferret out, or just essentially saying "yay!" without any logic necessarily behind our exclamation? The poet and philosopher Santayana thought that while aesthetic appreciation is an immediate experience--we don't "infer" the beauty of something by recognizing some natural qualities that it has--we can nonetheless analyze the experience after the fact to uncover a number of grounds on which we might appreciate something. He divides these into areas of matter (e.g. the pretty color or texture), form (the relations between perceived parts), and expression (what external to the work itself does it bring to mind?) and ends up being able to distinguish high art (form-centric) from more savage forms (centered on matter or expression) while distinguishing real appreciation (which can include any of the three elements) from mere pretension (when you don't really have an immediate experience at all but merely recognize that you're supposed to think that this is good).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The regular foursome talk through Santayana's theory with regard to expressionist painting, rock 'n roll, beautiful landscapes, abstract expressionism, and more. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/05/20/topic-for-77-santayana-on-the-appreciation-of-beauty/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Sense of Beauty" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;with help from some PEL listeners. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/06/07/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-sense-of-beautycall-for-musicians/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's &lt;em &gt;What Is Philosophy?&lt;/em &gt;(1991).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How is philosophy different from science and art? What's the relationship between different philosophies? Is better pursued solo, or in a group? Deleuze described philosophy as the creation of new concepts, whereas science is about functions that map observed regularities and art is about creating percepts and affects. Just reading or writing about past philosophers is not enough; you have to actually create concepts, and to create or understand a concept requires a "plane of immanence," which is something like a set of background intuitions that is not private to a particular mind. Such a plane constitutes an image of what thought is and determines what questions will be considered legitimate, so trying to evaluate a past philosophy without grappling with the plane means you'll inevitably misunderstand the philosopher and your critiques will just talk past him or her. Likewise, if you yank a philosophical concept out of its plane and try to turn it into a proposition that you can evaluate, it's inevitably going to seem weak, like "just an opinion," because propositions are not what philosophy creates. As for a pragmatist, "truth" for Deleuze is something defined within a plane, not some transcendental standard used to judge planes or concepts.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, and Dylan are joined by "sophist" (PhD in rhetoric) &lt;a href="http://www.joyfulcomplexity.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Coffeen &lt;/a &gt;to try to figure this out. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/04/26/topic-for-76-deleuzeguattari-on-what-philosophy-is/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Tolerated" by New People, from &lt;em &gt;Might Get It Right &lt;/em &gt;(2013).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Jacques Lacan's "Seminar on 'The Purloined Letter'" (1956), Jacques Derrida's "The Purveyor of Truth" (1975), and other essays in the collection &lt;em &gt;The Purloined Poe: Lacan, Derrida, and Psychoanalytic Reading &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How should philosophers approach literature? Lacan read Edgar Allen Poe's story about a sleuth who outthinks a devious Minister as an illustration of his model of the psyche, and why we persist in self-destructive patterns: we are driven by "the symbolic order," which tells us our place. The letter, which in the story is an embarrassing but unspecified message to the Queen that has been stolen by the Minister and used to blackmail her, is for Lacan a symbol for the power of the signifier, which dictates the roles of the various characters in the story, as first one then another is pushed into a passive, vulnerable state by gaining possession of it, driven by the logic that moves the letter inexorably back to its "rightful place."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Derrida thought this reading not only imposed a bunch of psychobabble onto the story, but demonstrated that Lacan just didn't know how to read a text. Per Derrida's deconstruction, you have to look at not only the themes the author presents, but at the technical aspects of the work and how they betray the author to serve up a different message. Lacan thinks he's getting at &lt;em &gt;the &lt;/em &gt;meaning of the text, but Derrida disavows the whole picture whereby such a meaning, or truth, can be revealed in this way.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;As both essays are tremendously obscure, who the hell knows if Derrida's assessment of Lacan even gets Lacan right, and the other authors in the collection have different takes on whose interpretation holds water, whether the Jacques are really more similar than they admit, and about how weird it is to be pouring criticism onto criticism of criticism. Mark, Seth, and Dylan do their best to wade through this morass and eke out a bit more understanding of Lacan (building on &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/04/03/ep74-lacan/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 74 &lt;/a &gt;), Derrida's view of language (see &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/02/24/episode-51-semiotics-and-structuralism-saussure-et-al/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 51 &lt;/a &gt;), and how &lt;em &gt;not &lt;/em &gt;to read a text. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/04/04/topic-for-75-lacan-derrida-on-literary-criticism-poes-the-purloined-letter/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Came Round" by Mark Linsenmayer, from 2010. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/01/20/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-week-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Is that the same as the experiencing subject? Lacan says no: while the self (the ego) is an imaginative creation, cemented by language, the subject is something else, something split (at least initially) between consciousness and the unconscious. Lacan mixes this Freudian picture with semiotics--an emphasis on systems of linguistic symbols--using this to both create his picture of the psyche and explain how psychological disorders arise.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The regular PEL foursome (with Wes acting much like a guest due to his formal study of psychoanalysis) try to make sense of this complex picture as presented by American psychoanalyst Fink and complain about Lacan's language as they wade into the nearly impenetrable writing of the Frenchman himself.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions &lt;/em &gt;, published mostly in 1962. The recording starts off with a short introduction by Dylan Casey.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does scientific knowledge simply accumulate as we learn more and more, coming closer and closer to a full and truthful picture of the world? Kuhn says no! Instead, each scientific sub-culture has its own "paradigm," or model for what constitutes legitimate science, which includes what problems to study, what to counts as a result, some background assumptions, and other things nebulous enough that you really can't enumerate them. While Kuhn still believes that the movement to a new paradigm constitutes progress in a sense, the traditional picture of progressive science is still wrong.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Dylan enthuses at a weary Mark, Wes, and Seth over this fast and furious book, which is chock full of stories about phlogiston and all things mechanico-corpuscular. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/12/11/topic86-kuhn/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Retrogress" from &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://marklint.com/fjt.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Fake Johnson Trio &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;New &amp;amp; Improved EP &lt;/em &gt;(1996), remixed now with freshly re-recorded vocals.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan share what drove them into philosophy and keeps them there. How is philosophy different than (or similar to) science? Than religion? Art?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The consensus seems that philosophy, to us, is inevitable for the curious. It's just inquiry, unbounded (in principle at least) by any fixed assumptions. While scientific and religious endeavors can be self-questioning as well, there's a limit to that self-questioning; you have to grant some foundational principles as true (e.g. about natural laws or the existence of God) as true before you can get far enough into your inquiry to figure out what questions are still to be answered. The same is true, of course, of particular philosophic inquiries (arguably, particular sciences are just more narrowly focussed, empirical strains of philosophy; that's certainly how the creation of sciences has played out historically), but for philosophy as a whole, nothing is off limits to questioning. So if the philosopher is ever questioning him or herself, how could that be pleasurable? How is it not nauseating? One solution: The Partially Examined Life, where you follow your intellectual conscience as best you can while accepting that you're probably still wrong about something you're taking for granted, and maybe you'll figure that bit out next week.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We did no formal reading for this discussion, but did tell each other to keep in mind Plato's "Apology."

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're joined by an international terrorism expert to discuss how to define terrorism and whether it can ever be ethical. We read:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;-Donald Black's "The Geometry of Terrorism" (2004)&lt;br/&gt;-J. Angelo Corlett's "Can Terrorism be Morally Justified?" (1996)&lt;br/&gt;-Igor Primoratz's article on terrorism in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2007, revised 2011)&lt;br/&gt;-Karl Heinzen's &lt;em &gt;Murder and Freedom &lt;/em &gt;(1853)&lt;br/&gt;-Bhagat Singh's "The Philosophy of the Bomb: A Brief Response to Gandhi" (1930)&lt;br/&gt;-Carl von Clausewitz's &lt;em &gt;On War &lt;/em &gt;(introduction) (1816ish)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Jon advises the U.S. government and has written textbooks on terrorism. He puts al-Qaeda in historical perspective, helps work through definitions from Black's "pure terrorism" (which has an "upwards" social geometry requiring both geographic access and cultural difference) to Corlett's attempt to construct a definition that doesn't automatically rig the moral question. Primoratz helps us ask whether harming innocents (e.g. in a war where you're threatened with extinction) is ever justified, and Heinzen and Singh preach violence against violence, where the state itself, being founded on violence, can't be effectively fought through "soul force" alone. We also discuss how the philosophical questions relate to the practical ones: do we even need a definition, or is a practical scheme of classification sufficient for all practical purposes? Plus, a bit on gun control and the state's monopoly on force. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/02/18/topic72-terrorism/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the readings &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "1000 Points of Light" by &lt;a href="http://www.marklint.com/maytrick.html" target="_blank"&gt;The MayTricks &lt;/a &gt;(1992). &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/03/09/1000-points-of-light/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Buber's 1923 book about the fundamental human position: As children, and historically (this is his version of social contract theory), we start fully absorbed in relation with another person (like, say, mom). Before that point, we have no self-consciousness, no "self" at all, really. It's only by having these consuming "encounters" that we gradually distinguish ourselves from other people, and can then engage in what we'd normally consider "experience," which Buber calls "the I-It relation," wherein we can reflect on and manipulate the world.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buber thinks that unless we can keep connected to this "I-Thou" phenomenon, through real, mature relationships (dialogue!), and maybe also through art and the appreciation of nature (we spend a lot of time trying to figure out how, as he says, you can really have an I-Thou encounter with a tree), you're spiritually dead, treating everyone as objects and sporting a thin, pissy sense of self to boot. If you get get in the groove, on the other hand, you'll come off all shiny and ethical and ready to transform the world. Sweet! Oh, and by the way, the "Thou," &lt;em &gt;every &lt;/em &gt;thou, ends up also being a direct line to God, so all you "spiritual but not religious" folks are theists after all. Nyah nyah!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, and Wes are rejoined by verbose lawyer Daniel Horne to hash through this difficult and possibly mystical text. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/02/01/topic-for-71-martin-bubers-i-and-thou/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about it and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Luscious You" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/fake.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint and the Fake &lt;/a &gt;from the album &lt;em &gt;So Whaddaya Think?&lt;/em &gt;(2000). &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/MLFalbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Download it free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Karl Marx's &lt;em &gt;The German Ideology &lt;/em &gt;, Part I, an early, unpublished work from 1846.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is human nature? What drives history? How can we improve our situation? Marx thought that fundamentally, you are what you do: you are your job, your means of subsistence. All the rest, this culture, this religion, this philosophy, is just a thin layer over our basic situation. Ideas are not primarily what changes the world; it's economics. In fact, you can't even &lt;em &gt;have &lt;/em &gt;an idea that doesn't end up being in some way a product of your economic situation, and any given culture inevitably reflects and reinforces the interests of the rich within that culture. Marx saw history as following an inevitable progression driven by the division of labor and development of technology, which would inevitably lead to a situation so awful for the vast majority that we'll have no choice but revolution leading to Communist paradise.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;OK, so that last part is a pretty big stretch, but some of Marx's diagnoses seem on point: our alienation from our jobs, the fact that our opinions really do more often than not reflect our situation and are not therefore the product of a wholly free intellectual choice, the fact that a lot of philosophy ignores our practical situation to its detriment (Marx really rips into the "Young Heglians" that were dominating German thought at the time), our general lack of self-knowledge (this idea among others being lifted from Hegel), and some of his analysis of past cultural advances (mostly lifted from Adam Smith). The original threesome of Mark, Seth, and Wes are back to hack into these issues and more. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/01/16/topic70-marx/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Job" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/fake.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint and the Fake &lt;/a &gt;from the album &lt;em &gt;So Whaddaya Think?&lt;/em &gt;(2000). &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/MLFalbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Download it free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Plato's Dialogue, "Gorgias" (380 BCE or so).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Why philosophize? Isn't it better to know how to persuade people in practical matters, like a successful lawyer or business leader? Plato (speaking as usual through Socrates) thinks that the "art" of rhetoric (persuasive speeches) isn't an art at all, in the sense of something that requires an understanding of one's subject matter, but merely a talent for saying what people want to hear. Gorgias (and Socrates's other interlocutors) think that being able to persuade gives you power, so it's awesome, but Plato thinks that unless what you say is likely to improve your audience, then it's worthless. The argument is generalizable to all artistic endeavor: Do the arts aim to just give pleasure, and even if they do, is that bad?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan kick this one off with some discussion of how we pick topics, and then stroll through the this very entertaining dialogue, which you can also hear us read &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/62066964" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/62067159" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;. We consider Plato's doctrine that knowledge inevitably leads to virtue and his insistence that goods can't contravene each other, so that pleasure over an injustice can't be good just because it's pleasurable, and acting justly must always be in our long-term interest, by definition. We wrap up by joining Socrates in dissing those that would dismiss philosophy as a waste of time. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/12/21/topic-for-69-platos-gorgias-on-rhetoric-vs-philosophy/" target="_blank"&gt;Get the book and read more about the topic &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Fallen Sun" by &lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New People &lt;/a &gt;(written/sung by Matt Ackerman) from &lt;em &gt;Might Get It Right &lt;/em &gt;(2013). &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Listening to this will be MIGHTY good preparation for listening to that discussion.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We are freely sharing the first half of this unabridged work of profound genius, in which Socrates (Mark) and his pal Chaerephon (Eileen), at the behest of Callicles (Dylan), call on the famous orator/teacher Gorgias (Seth) to ask him what this oratory crap is all about.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;After first trouncing Gorgias's student Polus (Evan), Socrates then eviscerates Gorgias himself, arguing that oratory is just a worthless form of flattery, like pastry baking (?!?!), feeding people what they want to hear while doing nothing to improve them. As part one concludes, Callicles steps up and gives Socrates a smackdown, arguing that orators, who argue the affairs of the state, have power, and hence happiness, and even though we may give lip service to the idea that exerting power unjustly is shameful, the law of nature says that more power is always better, and screw justice. And screw philosophy while you're at it, which is best left to undergrads to rant about in their dorm rooms and grow out of to go on and do real work.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The dialogue continues with &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/62067159" target="_blank"&gt;part two &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Starting off with an introduction by Mark Linsenmayer.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Frithjof is a world-renowned ex-Hegel/Nietzsche scholar who has worked since the early 80s on projects to realize the goal of "New Work," which is an alternative to the current, dysfunctional job system. New Work enables people to do work (which is not the same as a "job") that they really, really want. Human nature is not such that we are born free and need restraining by a social contract; rather, we need institutions to help us develop a self, to figure out what we really want and become free by doing things that we deeply identify with. New Work Enterprises promotes technology like fabricators and cutting-edge farming to support community self-sufficiency in places like &lt;a href="http://newworknewculture.com/content/detroit" target="_blank"&gt;Detroit &lt;/a &gt;that the job system has left behind.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On his book &lt;em &gt;Constructing the World &lt;/em &gt;(2012).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How are all the various truths about the world related to each other? David Chalmers, famous for advocating a scientifically respectable form of brain-consciousness dualism, advocates a framework of scrutability: if one knew some set of base truths, then the rest would be knowable from them. What sort of base? Well, there may be many principles bases, and what's important for Chalmers is not the details of which is picked but of the scrutability framework as a whole. The base he discusses the most in the book is PQTI, for Physical, Qualia (mental), "That's all," and Indexical (like "I'm here now). Being able to derive the rest of reality from PQTI has implications, Chalmers thinks, for the philosophy of language, mind, and metaphysics.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark tries to draw Chalmers into speculating outside his areas of expertise. Dylan asks about physics, of course. Wes has technical issues and drops off half way through (listen for the "ping" as he texts Mark to that effect). &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/12/04/topic68-chalmers/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the project and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "What You Want" by &lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New People &lt;/a &gt;, from &lt;em &gt;Might Get It Right &lt;/em &gt;(2013). &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Rudolph Carnap's &lt;em &gt;The Logical Structure of the World &lt;/em &gt;(1928).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What can we know? Carnap thinks that all the various spheres of knowledge (e.g. particle physics, attributions of mental states, moral claims, the economy) are logically interrelated, that you can in fact translate sentences about any of these into sentences about sets of basic, momentary experiences. This book, better known as the &lt;em &gt;Aufbau &lt;/em &gt;, is Carnap's attempt to sketch out how this system of linguistic reduction can work. Though it certainly doesn't work, it's a pretty damned fascinating attempt.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Carnap's hope was to integrate the language of scientific discourse with that of mathematics, and in doing so clarify traditional philosophical problems, in part by showing that anything that can't be recast in this philosophically respectable symbolic language is a bunch of vague nonsense. So we can describe the relations between the various contents of our experience, but the question of what these entities &lt;em &gt;really &lt;/em &gt;are (i.e. the traditional realism vs. idealism debate) doesn't and can't arise in the system. Carnap at some points described himself neutral about such questions, but at others as hostile towards the dead-end sort of philosophy that generated them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Matt Teichman rejoins Mark, Wes, and Dylan to get into some of the details of this very funky constructional system and try to figure out what good it is and whether one can really ignore such metaphysical questions when doing science. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/11/12/topic67-carnap/" target="_blank"&gt;Read Mark's spiffy essay summarizing the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Undershirt" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;, the recording was produced and many instruments played by &lt;a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/edisoncarter" target="_blank"&gt;Edison Carter &lt;/a &gt;for his Talk Zack Talk &lt;em &gt;Wound EP &lt;/em &gt;in 1996.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On W.V.O. Quine's "On What There Is" (1948) and "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1951).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What kind of metaphysics is compatible with science? Quine sees science and philosophy as one and the same enterprise, and he objects to ontologies that include types of entities that science can't, even in principle, study. In these two highly influential essays, he first tells how to determine what ontological commitments your philosophical theory is making, and he advocates for one that, for instance, doesn't allow talk of the "possible twin sister" that you could have had but didn't. In particular, Quine doesn't want an ontology to have linguistic meanings in it. Sure, sentences can be meaningful, but that doesn't mean that the sentence refers to or makes use of some entity, the meaning, that must exist (as Frege thought) outside of the head of any speaker.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;In "Two Dogmas," he takes on a related point: the concept of synonymy, or "same meaning." We think that some sentences are true by definition ("Bachelors are unmarried") or true in virtue of logic alone ("x=x," "2+2=4"), while others ("my dog is on fire") require that we go out and look at the world to determine their truth. Quine challenges this distinction, arguing instead that our truths don't get individually verified by experience, but "face the court of experience as corporate body." So if I have an experience that seems to violate an established scientific law, I have leeway in which part of the "web of belief" can be adjusted to accommodate the new information. The statements we might have thought are analytically true (true by definition or logic) are really just those which most resist change. Quine drives us to this conclusion by allegedly showing that "true by definition" can't be explained without circularity: we always end up referring to some version of "same meaning," like synonymy or analyticity or a priori or necessarily true, and it's this set of terms that we're trying to give an account for.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Wes, Seth, and Dylan are joined by &lt;a href="http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/podcasts/elucidations.html" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Teichman of the Elucidations Podcast &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/10/17/topic-for-66-quine-on-language-logic-and-science/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the texts.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Granted" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;(2012).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Alexander Hamilton/James Madison's &lt;em &gt;Federalist Papers &lt;/em &gt;(1, 10-12, 14-17, 39, 47-51), published as newspaper editorials 1787-8, plus Letters III and IV from Brutus, an Anti-Federalist.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What constitutes good government? These founding fathers argued that the proposed Constitution, with its newly centralized--yet also separated-by-branch--powers would be a significant improvement on the Articles of Confederation, which had left states as the ultimate sovereigns.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Hear Dylan, Mark, and Seth here rap about factions: Does our current system prevent the abuse of power by interest groups in the way Madison predicted it would? (Hint: no.) If we want to argue for change, we have to diagnose what went wrong in this and other instances: is it that Madison's/Hamilton's predictions were simply wrong in some areas, or have the contextual facts (e.g. education and technology levels) changed the situation, and/or do we simply have different central concerns now than we did then? For instance, their fresh-from-the-revolution audience was worried about kingly tyranny, and European powers were skeptical of any democracy, while we face new challenges like the rise of corporations that apparently have personhood according to our Supreme Court. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/09/26/topic-for-65-federalist-papers/" target="_blank"&gt;Learn more about the topic and get the readings.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Feeling Time" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Madison Lint &lt;/a &gt;(2002).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On philosophical issues in McCarthy's 2005 novel about guys running around with drug money and shooting each other, and about fiction as a form for exploring philosophical ideas.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What can morality mean for people who have witnessed the "death of God," i.e. a loss in faith in light of the horrors of war? For both the protagonist and antagonist in "No Country for Old Men," morality is about being satisfied with your own actions, even if what you've done is set in stone forever, and even if it were to be the last thing you do before death. This is not purely subjectivist, though, seemingly not just dependent upon our whims. In McCarthy's sort-of Nietzschean world, we have duties toward the dead, and duties towards ourselves. It's clear that this sort of "ethic" is not coincident with "ethics" as we're familiar with it, as it's something shared by both the risk-taker-with-a-heart-of-gold hero and the I'll-kill-you-like-cattle baddie.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What does McCarthy himself think? Who knows? Like many good philosophical novelists, he puts philosophies in the mouths of his characters to try them out as world views, to see how they hang psychologically and what fate they lead to, in the author's best estimation. Another peculiarity of the novel as ethical philosophy is that is provides a full-blown concrete ethical situation to analyze instead of a classroom abstraction.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss these issues and more with &lt;a href="http://jmc.msu.edu/contact/show.php?id=22" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Petrie &lt;/a &gt;, Professor at Michigan State University, who's an old friend and teacher of Dylan's. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/08/22/topic63/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "My Grandfather" by &lt;a href="http://dylancasey.org/music.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dylan Casey &lt;/a &gt;(2001).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Popular Enlightenment philosopher Leibniz argued that it's good by definition. God is perfectly good and all-powerful, so whatever he created must have been as good as it can be; we live in the best of all possible worlds.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Voltaire loads this satirical adventure story up with horrific violence to demonstrate that Leibniz's position is just silly. Life is filled with suffering, and human nature is such that even in peace and prosperity, we're basically miserable. Yet we still love life despite this. Voltaire's solution is to "tend your garden," which means something like engaging in meaningful work, whether personal or political.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is a very special episode for us, as it's our first with all of us recording in the same room, as part of a weekend of fun and frolic in Madison, WI. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/07/30/topic62/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Friedrich Nietzsche's "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" (1873).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is truth? This essay, written early in Nietzsche's career but unpublished during his lifetime, is taken by many to make the extreme claim that there is no truth, that all of the "truths" we tell each other are just agreements by social convention.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The regular foursome are joined by a U. Texas grad school classmate, &lt;a href="http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwphi/9562.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jessica Berry &lt;/a &gt;from Georgia State University. She argues that Nietzsche is really just being a skeptic here: our "truths" don't correspond with the thing-in-itself, i.e. the world beyond our human conceptions. He wants us to understand that all knowledge is laden with human interests. Taken this way, the essay won't undermine itself; if he isn't saying "there is no truth," then that claim won't apply to itself.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What Nietzsche for sure does say is that the "will to truth" that philosophers so prize is puzzling, given how beneficial to our survival many mutually held illusions are: we're safe, things are stable, we understand our environment. When philosophers declare truth to be the most valuable thing, they're going beyond the mundane purposes for which the will to truth developed (e.g. communicating in a consistent way to our mutual benefit) and massively overestimating our capability to know the world as it "really" is.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/07/15/topic61/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more on the topic and buy the book &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Aristotle's &lt;em &gt;Politics &lt;/em &gt;(350 BCE), books 1 (ch 1-2), 3, 4 (ch 1-3), 5 (ch 1-2), 6 (ch 1-6), and 7 (ch. 1-3, 13-15).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Aristotle provides both a taxonomy of the types of government, based on observations of numerous constitutions of the states of his time, and prescriptions on how to best order a state. These are meant to be practical; though he does spend some time on the "ideal" government, he recognizes that that's going to be very rare, given that it requires those in charge to be virtuous according to his stringent standards. He provides advice for all the types, whether rule by one, or the few, or the many, to help keep them stable and from drifting into their corrupt forms. He sees the state as a natural outgrowth of human nature, and that one can characterize the health of a state in much the way one can describe the health (i.e. virtue, happiness) of an individual. Yes, he's a major league elitist, but there's still some good stuff here, applicable even to modern times. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/06/21/topic60/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the book.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Don't Forget Where You Are," from the &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Linsenmayer &lt;/a &gt;album &lt;em &gt;Spanish Armada, Songs of Love and Related Neuroses &lt;/em &gt;(1993), newly remixed/remastered.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Alasdair MacIntyre's &lt;em &gt;After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory &lt;/em &gt;(1981), mostly ch. 3-7 and 14-17.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What justifies ethical claims? MacIntyre claims that no modern attempt to ground ethics has worked, and that's because we've abandoned Aristotle. We see facts and values as fundamentally different: the things science discovers vs. these weird things that have nothing to do with science. In Aristotle's teleological view, everything comes with built-in goals, so just as a plant will aim grow green and healthy, people have a definite kind of virtue towards which we do and should naturally strive. Though MacIntyre doesn't want to bring back Aristotle's biology, he does want to put the goal-directedness, i.e. the normativity, back into our conception of the facts of our lives.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;His new take on virtue has two components: the excellence involved in any established practice, like physics, cooking, or playing guitar; and the need to live a coherent life story given your particular culture and commitments. You might have bought into the aim to be a great chess player, for instance, which requires not only intellectual virtue, but being social enough to keep the enterprise of chess in business (i.e. no murder when you lose). To get from great chess player to great person means integrating your various practices into one fulfilling life, and MacIntyre thinks that this effort is sufficient to give you objective moral standards, given your particular practices and, moreso, your cultural traditions. Unlike the existentialists, MacIntyre thinks that for an individual in a real situation, having moral standards is not a matter of some free choice or "leap," as if morality was nothing in itself that we humans are bound to. No, morality is real, and fully justified, for an individual embedded in his culture and commitments. Just like you can't, yourself, decide to win at chess by changing the rules, you can't "create values" as Nietzsche might recommend by denying or re-interpreting your duties as parent, neighbor, citizen, etc.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The regular four continue the discussion started in &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/06/20/episode-58-what-grounds-ethical-claims-moore-stevenson-macintyre/" target="_blank"&gt;ep. 58 &lt;/a &gt;, giving some of MacIntyre's dismissal of dozens of major figures in philosophy and trying our best to make sense of his proposals. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0268035040/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0268035040" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Indefensible," by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;, 1998.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On G.E. Moore's &lt;em &gt;Principia Ethica &lt;/em &gt;, ch. 1 (1903); Charles Leslie Stevenson's "The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms" (1937), and Alasdair MacIntyre's &lt;em &gt;After Virtue &lt;/em &gt;, ch. 1-2.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is there such a thing as moral intuition? Is "good" a simple property that we all recognize but can't explain like yellow? G.E. Moore thinks that any attempt to define good in terms of properties like "pleasure," "interest," or "happiness" are doomed. Even if all pleasurable things were good, the word "good" still wouldn't &lt;em &gt;mean &lt;/em &gt;"pleasant;" you could always sensibly ask, "but are those pleasant things really good?" This is Moore's "open question" argument, which expresses his objection to the "naturalistic fallacy," i.e. deriving an "ought" from an "is."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Stevenson agreed that "good" isn't reducible to any natural property; saying something is good is not to express a property about it at all. Instead, moral terms are tools we use to convince other people to like things that we like. This tendency of the word "good" to elicit such a response is part of what Stevenson calls its "emotive meaning."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;MacIntyre thinks that this emotivism now pervades our current uses of ethical language. Because Moore is successful in debunking all the ethical theories that rely on natural facts (and supernatural ones too) to ground morality, we're left with no grounding at all, and people like Moore who pretend to be using intuition to discover primal moral facts are really just expressing their own preferences. The same goes for ethical theorists whose key terms don't hold up to scrutiny: when someone justifies an action by referring to a fiction like "greatest happiness," "natural rights," or "the dictates of reason," he is just, again, expressing his preferences; these bogus theories just serve to mask what's really going on. We'll give MacIntyre's positive account of how to ground morality (which is derived from Aristotle's) in episode 59.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/05/17/topic58/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the readings &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "When I Was Yours," by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;, 1997.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Bergson's &lt;em &gt;Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic &lt;/em &gt;(1900).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is humor? Bergson says that, fundamentally, we laugh as a form of social corrective when others are slow to adapt to society's demands. Other types of humor are derivative from this: just as the clown falls on his face because of a (pretended) physical flaw, as if he's a machine that doesn't work and so becomes noticeable as a machine, in satire, we poke fun at society's breaking down, and in wordplay it's as if the language is breaking down, and in a sit-com featuring unlikely coincidences, it's like fate itself is breaking down into senseless patterns of repetition.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan are joined by comedienne &lt;a href="http://www.jenisfamous.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Dziura &lt;/a &gt;, using Bergson as a jumping-off point to throw around lots of theories and questions: is it the unexpected that makes something funny (which would make timing key), or our identification with the funny situation, which would go against Bergson's notion that you need some distance from the person you're laughing at, or else you grasp him as an individual and get sucked into the breakdown as tragic? Can deformities be hilarious, as Bergson thinks? What about dark humor, or self-deprecating humor, or the laughter of delight or being tickled? &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/05/03/topic57/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more on the topic and get the book &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End songs: Another two lo-fi, quickly recorded driblets from the &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;album, &lt;em &gt;Black Jelly Beans &amp;amp; Smokes &lt;/em &gt;: 1991's “The Nipple Song" and a song written by the Gerber Brothers (Ken Gerber being the guy who drew our PEL icon) performed with Mark from 1990, "Come On, Lady."

Also, what does Wittgenstein mean by characterizing philosophical problems as mistakes of grammar, and how might that apply to the mind/body problem? Finally, we get to the private language argument, where W. argues that we don't talk about our pains and things by pointing at and naming our inner states. Language is inevitably public, and our language about pains grows out of observable pain behaviors. Does this make Wittgenstein a behaviorist, and so hopelessly antiquated?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, Part I, sections 1-33 and 191-360 (written around 1946).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is linguistic meaning? Wittgenstein argues that it's not some mysterious entity in the mind, but that it is a public matter: you understand a word if you can use it appropriately, and you know the context in which it's appropriate to use it and how to react when you hear it in that context. W. calls such a context a "language game," and sees language as big heap of these games, spanning a wide range of human activity. Words don't just name objects; they could be commands, or variables, or exclamations, or even meaningless when considered outside of a particular game. When philosophers pull words out of the kinds of settings in which they originated and try to figure out what they &lt;em &gt;really &lt;/em &gt;mean, that creates bogus philosophical problems.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This discussion is part 1 of 2; we only get through the first sections of the book in detail, and you'll have to listen to &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/05/14/ep56-wittgenstein-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;part 2 &lt;/a &gt;for a good explanation of the famous "private language" argument. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/04/04/topic55/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic and get the text &lt;/a &gt;.

In &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/03/26/ep53-buddhism-flanagan-citizen/" target="_blank"&gt;episode 53 &lt;/a &gt;, Owen Flanagan outlined a science-friendly project of comparative ethics, and touched on Buddhism's empiricist theory of knowledge and its metaphysics of impermanence.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On W.E.B. DuBois's "Of Our Spiritual Strivings" (1903), Cornel West's "A Genealogy of Modern Racism" (1982), and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail" (1963) and "The Black Power Defined" (1967), plus Malcolm X's "The Black Revolution" (1963).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What kind of philosophical lessons come out of the history of black oppression in America? Historian and intellectual DuBois describes the "double consciousness" involved living as a black man in the white world (he was the first black man to graduate from Harvard); he sees the oppression experience as providing some spiritual insight that the rest of us could use. West analyzes the codification of racist aesthetic standards in western philosophical history, leaving us with traces (a white "normative gaze") that require more than a tolerant attitude to root out. The American civil rights writers discuss the practical ways to combat this legacy, the upshot being that whites will not in themselves become enlightened and fix everything, but that blacks simply needed more economic, political, and cultural power.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Ferdinand de Saussure's &lt;em &gt;Course in General Linguistics &lt;/em &gt;(1916) (Part I and Part II, Ch. 4), Claude Levi-Strauss's "The Structural Study of Myth" (1955), and Jacques Derrida's "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences" (1966).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is language? What is the relation between language and reality? Saussure argued that a language at a given time has a structure, where you can only really understand the meaning (or "value") of a word by contrasting it with other words. Structuralists like Levi-Strauss generalized this to all of culture, and Derrida, while rejecting the structuralist project, takes the notion of "difference" between words to uproot all meaning from any non-linguistic reality. (Probably... even our guest &lt;a href="http://skepoet.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;C. Derick Varn &lt;/a &gt;who's read the Derrida essay dozens of times isn't sure what it means.) &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/02/01/now-taking-questions-on-semiotics-and-structuralism-saussure-levi-strauss-derrida/" target="_blank"&gt;Learn more about the topic and get the readings &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Slipped into Words," written and recorded by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mark &lt;/a &gt;in 1991, released on &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://marklint.com/maytrick.html" target="_blank"&gt;The MayTricks &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, which you &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/MayTricksAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;can freely download in full &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Michel Foucault's &lt;em &gt;Discipline and Punish &lt;/em &gt;(1975), parts 1, 2 and section 3 of part 3.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are we really free? Kings no longer exert absolute and arbitrary power over us, but Foucault's picture of the evolution from torture and public executions to rehabilitative, medical-style incarceration is not so much a triumph of liberty but a shift to more subtle but more pervasive exertions of power. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679752552/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0679752552 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=ZNAMCP72JM2O4XB5" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/12/15/topic-for-49-foucault-on-power-and-punishment/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Featuring guest participant &lt;a href="http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/student/katharine-mcintyre" target="_blank"&gt;Katie McIntyre &lt;/a &gt;, doctoral candidate at Columbia.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End songs: Two short, stinky tunes from the &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;album, &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://marklint.com/BlackJellyBeans.html" target="_blank"&gt;Black Jelly Beans &amp;amp; Smokes &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, "The Zoo Song" and "Solitary Drama," both from 1991.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Maurice Merleau-Ponty's "Primacy of Perception" (1946) and &lt;em &gt;The World of Perception &lt;/em &gt;(1948).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the relation of perception to knowledge? In M-P's phenomenology, perception is primary: even our knowledge of mathematical truths is in some way conditioned by and dependent on the fact that we are creatures with bodies and senses that work the way they do. Science is great, but it doesn't discover the truth of things hiding behind perception: it is an abstraction from certain kinds of perceptions. Other modes of approaching things, e.g. art, can equally well give us knowledge, though of a different kind.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, Wes, and Dylan argue over whether this thesis is just a bunch of truisms and despair over not having read &lt;em &gt;The Phenomenology of Perception &lt;/em &gt;, the longer work which what we did read was meant to summarize. Is M-P just saying that scientific knowledge is defeasible, which scientists already believe? &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/11/23/topic-for-48-merleau-ponty-on-the-role-of-perception-in-knowledge/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about this topic &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810120437/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=217145 &amp;amp;creative=399369 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0810120437" target="_blank"&gt;"The Primacy of Perception and its Philosophical Consequences,"&lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.bard.edu/library/arendt/pdfs/Merleau-Ponty-EssentialWritings.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is consciousness, and does it necessarily involve an "I" who is conscious of things? Sartre says no: typical experience is consciousnes &lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is consciousness, and does it necessarily involve an "I" who is conscious of things? Sartre says no: typical experience is consciousness of some object and doesn't involve the experience of myself as someone having this consciousness. It's only when we reflect on our own conscious experiences that we posit this "I." The ego is our own creation, or more precisely a social creation. This means that far from being some primordial structure of all experience, this transparent thing inside us that we have more immediate knowledge of than anything else, the ego is an object: it has parts we don't see, and we can be wrong when we make judgments about it. Other people might even know us better than we know ourselves.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is a difficult text, and we spend lots of time bickering about what Sartre might mean by terms like "transcendent" or "non-positional consciousness," so surely you will love that. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/11/11/topic-for-47-sartre-on-the-self/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809015455/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0809015455 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=ZHB3HPT56FTFGRWR" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or try &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t &amp;amp;rct=j &amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s &amp;amp;source=web &amp;amp;cd=5 &amp;amp;ved=0CEAQFjAE &amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcourses.arch.ntua.gr%2Ffsr%2F134757%2FSartre%2C%2520The%2520transcendence%2520of%2520ego-1.pdf &amp;amp;ei=2mC9TvyLGbC-2AX0vsGJBQ &amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGaSL1KsmkiJr7HrhRF7g1D83e2FQ &amp;amp;sig2=7mMOmBOSLIrW4XHdQ6ad0Q" target="_blank"&gt;this version online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Thing in the World," by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Plato's &lt;em &gt;Euthyphro &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Does morality have to be based on religion? Are good things good just because God says so, or (if there is a God) does God choose to approve of the things He does because he recognizes those things to be already good? Plato thinks the latter: if morality is to be truly non-arbitrary, then, like the laws of logic, it can't just be a contingent matter of what the gods happen to approve of (i.e. what some particular religious text happens to say).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're joined by &lt;a href="http://ancphil.lsa.umich.edu/people/faculty/evans/" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Evans &lt;/a &gt;, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan to discuss the text, which seems to be not as directly related to modern debates regarding the Divine Command Theory as we thought going into this.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing the arguments by Descartes, St. Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, William Paley, Kant, and others, as analyzed in J.L. Mackie's &lt;em &gt;The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God &lt;/em &gt;(1983), chapters 1-3, 5-6, 8, and 11.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Are the ontological, cosmological, and teleological (argument from design) arguments for God's existence any good? Mackie, a very sharp analytic philosopher well hooked into recent advances in philosophy of science, says no. He's chiefly responding to his Oxford colleague, Richard Swinburne, who takes a very rationalist approach to God, taking the concept of God to be wholly simple and intelligible and providing a superior scientific explanation for, e.g. the beginning of the universe than the brute fact of an ultimately uncaused physical universe. &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/08/09/topic-for-43-arguments-for-the-existence-of-god/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the topic &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hEWxpK" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more detail on Swinburne, read &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019958043X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=217145 &amp;amp;creative=399369 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=019958043X" target="_blank"&gt;Is There a God?&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1996).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark, Seth, and Wes are joined by &lt;a href="http://outsideofeden.squarespace.com/about-me/" target="_blank"&gt;groovy South African theist blogger &lt;/a &gt;Robert Scott.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "I Believe," by Mark Lint (2011). &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/09/15/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-i-believe/" target="_blank"&gt;Read about it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s utopian novel &lt;em &gt;Herland &lt;/em &gt;(1915) and psychologist Carol Gilligan's &lt;em &gt;In a Different Voice &lt;/em &gt;(1983).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How does human nature, and specifically moral psychology, vary by sex? Charlotte Perkins Gilman claims that when philosophers have described human nature as violent and selfish, they have in mind solely male nature. Females, left to themselves in an isolated society, would be supremely peaceful, rational, and cooperative.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Carol Gilligan says accounts of "normal" moral development have not taken into account observations of women: instead of judging women my male standards and finding them wanting, she hypothesized a trajectory specific to women that acknowledged their emphasis on concrete care as opposed to abstract moral principles.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Featuring the return of Seth and guest podcaster Azzurra Crispino, whom you might recall from &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/05/14/episode-19-kant-what-can-we-know/" target="_blank"&gt;our Kant epistemology episode &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;We spoke with Patricia Churchland after reading her new book &lt;em &gt;Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality.&lt;/em &gt;We also discussed David Hume's ethics as foundational to her work, reading his &lt;em &gt;Treatise on Human Nature &lt;/em &gt;(1739), Book III, Part I and his &lt;em &gt;Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals &lt;/em &gt;(1751), Section V, Parts I and II.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What does the physiology of the brain have to do with ethics? What bearing do facts have on values? Churchland thinks that while Hume is (famously) correct in saying that you can't deduce "ought" from "is," the fact that we have moral sentiments is certainly relevant to figuring out what our ethical positions should be, and it's her main goal to figure out what the mechanisms behind those moral sentiments are: What brain parts and processes are involved? How and when did these evolve? How did cultural factors come into play, building on top of our biological capacity to care for others?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Pat spoke with Mark and Dylan Casey here about topics ranging from the war on drugs to the rationale of punishment to Sam Harris's book &lt;em &gt;The Moral Landscape &lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing &lt;em &gt;The Republic &lt;/em &gt;by Plato, primarily books 1 and 2.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is justice? What is the ideal type of government? In the dialogue, Socrates argues that justice is real (not just a fiction the strong make up) and that it's not relative to who you are (in the sense that it would always be just to help your friends and hurt your enemies). Justice ends up being a matter of balancing your soul so the rational part is in control over the rest of you.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Republic is Plato's utopia, described by analogy with justice in the individual: In the ideal state, the rational people will be in charge, and these leaders should go through rigorous conditioning and live communally (spouse sharing!) in order for them to serve the state effectively.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You'll hear Wes and Dylan Casey talk about their &lt;a href="http://www.sjca.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;St. John's &lt;/a &gt;experiences (the "Johnny" discussion-only format provides a chief model for P.E.L.'s).

Schleiermacher says no: the essence of religion is an emotional response to life; it doesn't give knowledge or even tell us what to do exactly.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Russell's &lt;em &gt;Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy &lt;/em &gt;(1919), ch. 1-3 and 13-18.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How do mathematical concepts like number relate to the real world? Russell wants to derive math from logic, and identifies a number as a set of similar sets of objects, e.g. "3" just IS the set of all trios. Hilarity then ensues.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This book is a shortened and much easier to read version of Russell and Whitehead's much more famous &lt;em &gt;Principia Mathematica &lt;/em &gt;, and given that we can't exactly walk through the specific steps of lots of proofs on a purely audio podcast (nor would we want to put you through that), we spend some of the discussion comparing analytic (with its tendency to over-logicize) and continental (with its tendency towards obscurity) philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Featuring guest podcaster and number guy &lt;a href="http://joshpelton.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Josh Pelton &lt;/a &gt;, filling in for Seth.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://people.umass.edu/klement/russell-imp.html" target="_blank"&gt;Read with us online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QGXU92/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004QGXU92" target="_blank"&gt;buy the book.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Words and Numbers," by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/madisonlint.htm/samples.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &amp;amp; the Madison Lint Ensemble &lt;/a &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/05/28/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-words-numbers/" target="_blank"&gt;read more about this tune &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing John Locke's &lt;em &gt;Second Treatise on Government &lt;/em &gt;(1690).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What makes political power legitimate? Like &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/06/07/episode-3-hobbess-leviathan-the-social-contract/" target="_blank"&gt;Hobbes &lt;/a &gt;, Locke thinks that things are less than ideal without a society to keep people from killing us, so we implicitly sign a social contract giving power to the state. But for Locke, nature's not as bad, so the state is given less power. But how much less? And what does Locke think about tea partying, kids, women, acorns, foreign travelers, and calling dibs?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Part 2 of our discussion of G.F.W. Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;, covering sections 178-230 within section B, "Self-Consciousness." Part 1 is &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/04/02/episode-35-hegel-on-self-consciousness-2/" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;First, Hegel's famous "master and slave" parable, whereby we only become fully self-conscious by meeting up with another person, who (at least in primordial times, or maybe this happens to everyone as they grow up, or maybe this is all just happening in one person's head... who the hell knows given the wacky way Hegel talks)? Then the story leads into stoicism, skepticism, and the "unhappy consciousness" (i.e. Christianity). We are again joined by &lt;a href="http://zuhanden.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tom McDonald &lt;/a &gt;, though Wes is out sick. Wild speculation and disagreements of interpretation abound!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198245971?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198245971" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the peach translation by A.V.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing G.F.W. Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Phenomenology of Spirit &lt;/em &gt;(1807), Part B (aka Ch. 4), "Self-Consciousness," plus recapping the three chapters before that (Part A. "Consciousness").&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is discussion one of two: here we only get as far as "The Truth of Self-Certainty," i.e. sections 166-177. This is plenty, though, as this may be the most difficult text in the history of philosophy.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss Hegel's weird dialectical method and what it says about his metaphysics, in particular about ourselves: not static, pre-formed balls of self-interest, but something that needs to be actively formed through reflection, which in turn is only possible because of our interactions with other people. Featuring guest podcaster &lt;a href="http://zuhanden.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tom McDonald &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198245971?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198245971" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book,&lt;/a &gt;or you look at &lt;a href="http://terrypinkard.weebly.com/phenomenology-of-spirit-page.html" target="_blank"&gt;this alternate translation by Terry Pinkard online &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Gottlob Frege's "Sense and Reference," "Concept and Object" (both from 1892) and "The Thought" (1918).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is it about sentences that make them true or false? Frege, the father of analytic philosophy who invented modern symbolic logic, attempted to codify language in a way that would make this obvious, which would ground mathematics and science. Applying his symbolic system to natural language forced him to invent strange entities like "thoughts" and "senses" that are neither physical nor psychological, and we pretty much spend this episode kvetching about the metaphysical implications of this and the fact that Frege didn't care about them.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Featuring guest podcaster Matt Teichman, who also hosts &lt;a href="http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/podcasts/elucidations.html" target="_blank"&gt;Elucidations &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read along: "&lt;a href="http://philo.ruc.edu.cn/logic/reading/Frege_The%20Thought.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Thought &lt;/a &gt;," "&lt;a href="http://philo.ruc.edu.cn/logic/reading/On%20sense%20and%20reference.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;On Sense and Reference &lt;/a &gt;," "&lt;a href="http://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_ocao.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;On Concept and Object,&lt;/a &gt;" and we also read &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=OOF348zKgVoC &amp;amp;pg=PA1 &amp;amp;dq=frege+%22the+basic+laws+of+arithmetic%22,%22in+this+book+there+are+to+be+found%22 &amp;amp;hl=en &amp;amp;sa=X &amp;amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIp_KzvsDqyAIVBqceCh3T8wFO#v=onepage &amp;amp;q=frege%20%22the%20basic%20laws%20of%20arithmetic%22%2C%22in%20this%20book%20there%20are%20to%20be%20found%22 &amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;Frege's introduction (p. 12-25) to his book &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=OOF348zKgVoC &amp;amp;pg=PA1 &amp;amp;dq=frege+%22the+basic+laws+of+arithmetic%22,%22in+this+book+there+are+to+be+found%22 &amp;amp;hl=en &amp;amp;sa=X &amp;amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIp_KzvsDqyAIVBqceCh3T8wFO#v=onepage &amp;amp;q=frege%20%22the%20basic%20laws%20of%20arithmetic%22%2C%22in%20this%20book%20there%20are%20to%20be%20found%22 &amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;The Basic Laws of Arithmetic: Exposition of the System &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(1904), or just buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0631194452/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0631194452" target="_blank"&gt;this book.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "The Great Forgotten Lover," from &lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the 2011 New People album, &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Impossible Things &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Martin Heidegger's &lt;em &gt;Being and Time &lt;/em &gt;(1927), mostly the intro and ch. 1 and 2 of Part 1.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;When philosophers try to figure out what really exists (God? matter? numbers?), Heidegger thinks they've forgotten a question that really should come first: what is it to exist? He thinks that instead of asking "What is Being?" we ask, as in a scientific context, "what is this thing?" This approach then poisons our ability to understand ourselves or the world that we as human beings actually inhabit, as opposed to the abstraction that science makes out of this.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This is Seth's big episode: this was his primary concentration in his later grad school years. Plus: Nazis, trying to figure out things by free associating about their origins in ancient Greek, and whoopee cushion record breaking news!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.morelightinmasonry.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Heidegger-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061575593?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061575593" target="_blank"&gt;buy it.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Find You Out," by &lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New People &lt;/a &gt;, from &lt;em &gt;Impossible Things &lt;/em &gt;(2011). &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2006/01/01/mark-lint-music/" target="_blank"&gt;Get the album for free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Edmund Husserl's &lt;em &gt;Cartesian Meditations &lt;/em &gt;(1931).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How can we analyze our experience? Husserl thinks that Descartes was right about the need to ground science from the standpoint of our own experience, but wrong about everything else. Husserl recommends we "bracket" the question of whether the external world exists and just focus on the contents of our consciousness (the "cogito"). He thinks that with good, theory-free observations (meaning very difficult, unnatural language), we can give an account of the essential structures of experience, which will include truth, certainty, and objectivity (intersubjective verifiability): all that science needs. We'll find that we don't need to ground the existence of objects in space and other minds, because our entire experience presupposes them; they're already indubitable.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plus &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2011/02/07/personal-philosophies-wrap-up-for-the-moment/" target="_blank"&gt;"Personal Philosophies"&lt;/a &gt;for Seth and Wes!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/wp-content/uploads/Husserl-Cartesian-Meditations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the text online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/902470068X?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=902470068X" target="_blank"&gt;purchase it.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Sleep," from the &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Linsenmayer &lt;/a &gt;album &lt;em &gt;Spanish Armada, Songs of Love and Related Neuroses &lt;/em &gt;(1993).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Arthur Schopenhauer's &lt;em &gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason &lt;/em &gt;, published in 1847 (as an expansion of his doctoral thesis from 1813).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What kinds of explanations are legitimate? S. thought that causal and logical explanations are often confused, resulting in philosophical errors. In laying out the four types of explanation -- the four versions of the principle of sufficient reason -- he clearly elaborates his modernized Kantian epistemology. We also discuss his strange notion of "will" that was so influential on Nietzsche and Freud. Plus, we discuss &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977832937?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0977832937" target="_blank"&gt;"Action Philosophers!"&lt;/a &gt;and "Walking Dead."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read the book online &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/details/onthefourfoldroo00schouoft" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1409924378?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1409924378" target="_blank"&gt;purchase it.&lt;/a &gt;We also read &lt;a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/schopenh.htm" target="_blank"&gt;this chunk of &lt;/a &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/schopenh.htm" target="_blank"&gt;The World As Will and Representation &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "The Answer," by &lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New People &lt;/a &gt;from &lt;em &gt;Impossible Things &lt;/em &gt;(2011)&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Soren Kierkegaard's "The Sickness Unto Death" (1849).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is the self? For K. we are a tension between opposites: necessity and possibility, the finite and the infinite, soul and body. He thinks we're all in despair, whether we know it or not, because we wrongly think we're something we're not, or we reject what we are, or we just don't pay attention to this dynamic at all: we just go along with the crowd. So we need to keep self-examining and (he thinks) ultimately embrace our subservience to God.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Joined by guest podcaster/Kiekegaard's lawyer &lt;a href="http://www.avvo.com/attorneys/94133-ca-daniel-horne-1402372.html" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Horne &lt;/a &gt;, we consider K.'s 3-step self-help program and whether there's anything to be gotten here if you don't subscribe to K's Christianity.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Goodman's &lt;em &gt;Ways of Worldmaking &lt;/em &gt;(1978). What's the relationship between art and science? Does understanding works of art constitute "knowledge," and if so, how does this relate to other kinds of knowledge? Goodman describes art as a symbol system (including art like instrumental music that doesn't seem representative), which can symbolize successfully or not. While there is no one set of concepts by which to judge all art (different types of art and other descriptive endeavors establish incommensurable "worlds"), neither is art an anything goes endeavor where the individual spectator is the only determinant of quality.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're joined by painter &lt;a href="http://jaybailey.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Bailey &lt;/a &gt;to bring up lots of amusing artwork examples (The Monkees! Thomas Kinkade! Self-mutilation as art!) and tell us how well Goodman's account accords with his understanding of artistic practice (his answer: not so well).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0915144514?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0915144514" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the text.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Staple Gun" by &lt;a href="http://www.marklint.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint and Stevie P &lt;/a &gt;(1999).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Primarily discussing "Reasoning: The Sixty Stanzas" and "Emptiness: The Seventy Stanzas," by the 2nd century Indian Buddhist Nagarjuna.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is the world of our experience ultimately real? If not, does it have something metaphysically basic underlying it? For Nagarjuna, the answers are "no" and "no... well... not that we can talk about."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark and Seth are joined by guest Erik Douglas to discuss metaphysics, causality, the possibility of remaking your perceptual habits, why someone who believes that all is empty might still want to act ethically, and how to deny a claim without affirming its equally dubious opposite.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Look at &lt;a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/nagarjuna.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this document &lt;/a &gt;for our primary texts plus a couple of others that we mention; we also skimmed &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://buddhism-guide.com/buddhism/fundamental_verses_of_the_middle_way.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing &lt;em &gt;Civilization and its Discontents &lt;/em &gt;(1930).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's the meaning of life? Well, for Sigmund Freud, an objective purpose rises or falls with religion, which he thinks a matter of clinging to illusion, so to rephrase: what do we want out of life? To be happy, of course, yet he sees happiness as a matter of fulfillment of pent-up desires, meaning it's by its nature temporary. Yet we can't shake off its pursuit, and so we're in a bind, and have a number of strategies for obtaining some satisfaction: some compensation for what we have to repress in order to live in a society that forces us to repress our innate desires.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://ia340931.us.archive.org/0/items/CivilizationAndItsDiscontents/freud_civilization_and_its_discontents.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the book online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393304515?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393304515" target="_blank"&gt;purchase it.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "The Easy Thing" by &lt;a href="http://newpeopleband.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New People &lt;/a &gt;from &lt;em &gt;The Easy Thing &lt;/em &gt;(2009).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Are savages really slavering beasts of unquenchable appetites, or probably more mellow, hangin' about, flexin' their muscles, just chillin', eh?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Rousseau engages in some wild speculation about the development of humanity from the savage to the modern, miserable wretch.

Is belief in science or rationality itself a form of faith? Is religious belief a "forced choice," or does it just not matter what you believe?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also, we sort further through James on truth: truth is created by us, but what does that mean? That only statements actually verified or otherwise useful are true, or can have a truth value (true of false) at all? In saying that we create truth, does that make James a relativist, and if so, is that bad?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read "&lt;a href="http://falcon.jmu.edu/~omearawm/ph101willtobelieve.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Will to Believe &lt;/a &gt;," &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5116" target="_blank"&gt;Pragmatism &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;, and &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/James/James_1911/James_1911_toc.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Meaning of Truth &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;(the most useful chapters for our purposes are 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 15).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;You can alternately "The Will to Believe" &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/147017961X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=147017961X &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=EKSTHD2XM23TXDGK" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, and the other two books are packaged &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674697375/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674697375 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=45FKENOJNLZGPDXZ" target="_blank"&gt;in this volume &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Who Cares What You Believe?" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/madisonlint.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Madison Lint &lt;/a &gt;(2001).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing articles by Alan Turing, Gilbert Ryle, Thomas Nagel, John Searle, and Dan Dennett.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What is this mind stuff, and how can it "be" the brain? Can computers think? No? What if they're really sexified? Then can they think? Can the mind be a computer? Can it be a room with a guy in it that doesn't speak Chinese? Can science completely understand it? ...The mind, that is, not the room, or Chinese. What is it like to be a bat? What about a weevil? Do you even know what a weevil is, really? Then how do you know it's not a mind? Hmmmm? Is guest podcaster Marco Wise a robot? Even his wife cannot be sure!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We introduce the mind/body problem and the wackiness that it engenders by breezing through several articles, which you may read along with us:&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;1. Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “&lt;a href="http://loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html" target="_blank"&gt;Computing Machinery and Intelligence.&lt;/a &gt;"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;2. A chapter of Gilbert Ryle's 1949 book &lt;em &gt;The Concept of Mind &lt;/em &gt;called "&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/8911778/Gilbert-Ryle-Descartes-Myth" target="_blank"&gt;Descartes' Myth.&lt;/a &gt;"&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;3.

John Searle's Chinese Room argument, discussed in a 1980 piece, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071210043312/http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html" target="_blank"&gt;"Minds, Brains and Programs."&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;5.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On &lt;em &gt;Pragmatism &lt;/em &gt;(1907) by William James and "The Fixation of Belief" (1877) and "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" (1878) by Charles Sanders Peirce.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Is truth a primitive relation between our representations and things objectively in the world, or is it an analyzable process by which propositions "prove their worth" by being useful in some way, like by fitting well with other portions of our experience or being delicious?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Peirce, the inventor of pragmatism, focuses on the philosophy of science and thinks of inquiry as a way for us to just settle on any belief we can stomach.

He insists that once you read his book, you'll never be satisfied with such "twaddle" again!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong &gt;LEARN &lt;/strong &gt;about the faculties of Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason! &lt;strong &gt;THINK &lt;/strong &gt;about whether geometric truths are justified by our intuition of space (maybe) and arithmetic is grounded in our intuition of time (probably not). &lt;strong &gt;DOUBT &lt;/strong &gt;whether we actually impose causality on our experience as Kant says! &lt;strong &gt;MARVEL &lt;/strong &gt;at our guest participant, Azzurra Crispino, as she augments the number of speakers on this episode to a &lt;strong &gt;PERFECTLY SQUARE &lt;/strong &gt;number! &lt;strong &gt;GAWK &lt;/strong &gt;as your world is turned up-flicking-side down by Kant's "Copernican Revolution" (a term we neither use nor explain in this episode)!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://philosophy.eserver.org/kant-prolegomena.txt" target="_blank"&gt;Read the book online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872205932/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0872205932 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=56GADTUTO47HLSWI" target="_blank"&gt;buy it &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Subjectivity" from the 1994 album "Happy Songs Will Bring You Down" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/maytrick.html" target="_blank"&gt;The MayTricks &lt;/a &gt;. &lt;a href="https://marklint.bandcamp.com/album/happy-songs-will-bring-you-down" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the album &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On the Theaetetus and the Meno, two dialogues about knowledge.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We're returning to Plato for a somewhat more thorough treatment than we gave him in &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/05/12/part-1-of-episode-1-the-unexamined-life-is-not-worth-living/" target="_blank"&gt;Episode 1 &lt;/a &gt;. This should be considered part two (Hume being #1) of three discussions intended to convey the main conflict in the history of epistemology between the empiricists (like Hume) and the rationalists (like Plato).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We slog through most of the Theaetetus, where Plato considers and rejects a series of mostly very lame conceptions of knowledge and replaces them at the end with... NOTHING. Seth is crushed. In the Meno, knowledge is "remembrance" (maybe), like anything worth knowing can't be learned but only elicited out of the depths of your unconscious.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read along: &lt;a href="http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/plato_theaetetus.htm" target="_blank"&gt;The Theaetetus &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/plato_meno01.htm" target="_blank"&gt;The Meno &lt;/a &gt;, or if you don't like the funky background on those pages, look them up via &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/p" target="_blank"&gt;Project Gutenberg &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On David Hume's &lt;em &gt;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding &lt;/em &gt;(1748).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;David Hume thinks that all we can know are our own impressions, i.e. what our moment-to-moment experiences tell us. Funny thing, though: he thinks that no experience shows us one event causing another event. We only experience one thing happening, then another, and these sequences tend to display a lot of uniformity. So, if we have any legitimate idea of causality at all, it must just be that: regular patterns of conjoined events.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;We discuss what Hume thinks this view implies for the free will question, belief in miracles, whether external objects are actually there, Seth's experience of Towlie, and more. &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662" target="_blank"&gt;Read the book online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872202291/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0872202291 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=EDJFEME6EPIZSVXM" target="_blank"&gt;go buy it &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Twitch" by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/maytrick.html" target="_blank"&gt;The MayTricks &lt;/a &gt;, from the 1994 album &lt;em &gt;Happy Songs Will Bring You Down &lt;/em &gt;. &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/HappySongsAlbum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Get the whole thing free &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;What effect should the avant garde have on our understanding of what art is? We read three essays by modern, first-rate American philosopher Arthur Danto, all published in &lt;em &gt;The Philosophical Disenfranchisement of Art &lt;/em &gt;(1986): the title essay, "The Appreciation and Interpretation of Works of Art," and "The End of Art."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;I understand you may not have heard of Danto, and you may think modern art is goofy, but you'll definitely enjoy this discussion and the reading anyway. Danto gives a picture of philosophy and art at war throughout history: philosophy says that art can't get at truth and is otherwise useless, yet philosophers like Plato seem afraid of the power of art to corrupt. What's the deal?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Also, Danto claims that art is over; the end of art has happened. So suck it, artists. (Actually, artists can keep on doing what they're doing; they're fine, yet art is still over.) Plus, can you stare at a urinal and thereby make it art? What if it's in a museum? Danto loves them crazy ass post-modern artists, and thinks that their work shows that art was not what we thought it was.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plus, Seth talks about the plane crashing into the IRS building near his house, and we respond some listener postings.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Danto's book is definitely &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231132271/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=217145 &amp;amp;creative=399377 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0231132271" target="_blank"&gt;worth purchasing.&lt;/a &gt;We also refer heavily to Calvin Tomkins's &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140043136/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=217145 &amp;amp;creative=399377 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140043136" target="_blank"&gt;The Bride and the Bachelors &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140043136/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=217145 &amp;amp;creative=399377 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140043136" target="_blank"&gt;.&lt;/a &gt;For a summary of "The End of Art," you can read &lt;a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s5911.html" target="_blank"&gt;this excerpt from one of Danto's later books &lt;/a &gt;.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing G.W.F Hegel's &lt;em &gt;Introduction to the Philosophy of History &lt;/em &gt;. Though he didn't actually write a book with this name, notes on his lectures on this topic were published after his death, and the first chunk of that serves as a good entrance point to Hegel's very strange system.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;How should a philosopher approach the study of history? Is history just a bunch of random happenings, or is it a purposive force manipulating us to fulfill its hidden ends? If you have asked yourself this question in this way, then you, like Hegel, are mighty strange.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Here we talk about the unfolding of the world-historical spirit, world-historical individuals (hint: not you), dialectic, his alternative to the social contract, the formation of the self based on what others label you, the geist of America, why a constitutional monarchy is obviously the best form of government, and heaps more.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read with us: Pages 14-128 of &lt;a href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/hegel/history.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;this online version &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456514776/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=217145 &amp;amp;creative=399373 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1456514776" target="_blank"&gt;buy the book with only the part we're concerned with.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End Song: "Cold," by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/madisonlint.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Madison Lint &lt;/a &gt;(2004), described in &lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/02/19/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-week-8/" target="_blank"&gt;my music blog &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Reading Niccolò Machiavelli's &lt;em &gt;The Prince &lt;/em &gt;and Ch. 1-20 of &lt;em &gt;The Discourse on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy &lt;/em &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What's a philosophically astute approach to political matters? What makes a government successful? Should you keep that fortress or sell it for scrap? If you conquer, say, Iraq, do you have to then go and live there for the occupation to work out? Is it OK to display the heads of your enemies on spikes, or should you opt for a respectful diorama?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Besides the famous &lt;em &gt;Prince &lt;/em &gt;, Mr. M. wrote, at about the same time, the &lt;em &gt;Discourses on Livy &lt;/em &gt;which focus on republics instead of princedoms, so the combined picture is less out of sync with our time than you might think, meaning we talk about G.W. Bush for a bit (sorry).&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plus: An inspirational speech to play at middle school assemblies across the land!&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Skim the texts at &lt;a href="http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince00.htm" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy_.htm" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;, or you can &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0075535777/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=217145 &amp;amp;creative=399377 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0075535777" target="_blank"&gt;buy this book that includes both works.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The Isaiah Berlin article we talk about a bit is "The Originality of Machiavelli," which you read most of if you search for the essay title in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Zjv9fBU-YRoC &amp;amp;dq=berlin+the+proper+study+of+mankind &amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s" target="_blank"&gt;this book preview.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;End song: "Se Piangi, Se Ridi" (Mogol/Marchetti/Satti), recorded by &lt;a href="http://marklint.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lint &lt;/a &gt;in 2000.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;On Werner Heisenberg’s “Physics and Philosophy" (1958), and talking about it with an actual former particle physicist, Dylan Casey.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;What weird stuff about reality does quantum physics imply? Is Heisenberg (of the Uncertainty Principle fame) right that we need to reject "metaphysical realism" based on this very well established scientific framework? The discussion ranges over the uncertainty principle, relativity, wave/particle duality, Pre-Socratic metaphysics, why Kant is wrong about space, and lots of very weird things.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/13499208/PHYSICS-AND-PHILOSOPHY-by-WERNER-HEISENBERG" target="_blank"&gt;Read the text online &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061209198/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;camp=217145 &amp;amp;creative=399377 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061209198" target="_blank"&gt;purchase it.&lt;/a &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Plus, we spend far too much time talking about an article by Thomas Nagel about intelligent design; you can read that &lt;a href="http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1172/papa_132.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a &gt;.

What could it possibly mean to "make all things equal?" and how is the Taoist sage different from our other favorite paragons of virtue (hint: magical powers)?&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Featuring special guest panelist Erik Douglas, another U. Texas philosophy grad school dropout calling in from England and knowing more about Eastern philosophy than we do.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231105959/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=0231105959 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20" target="_blank"&gt;Buy the book &lt;/a &gt;or &lt;a href="http://terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu.html" target="_blank"&gt;read it online &lt;/a &gt;.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;The end song requires explanation: I had a "New Age" period where I investigated Eastern philosophy, tried to be cheerful all the time, and was generally insufferable. This song, "Pass Time Incorporeal," is an artifact of that time, with lyrics from early fall 1989; the recording is from 1993. It finally slipped out on a 1996 album of similar goofiness rejected from my "real" albums called "&lt;a href="http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/06/19/partially-naked-self-examination-music-blog-black-jelly-beans-smokes-now-available-for-free-download/" target="_blank"&gt;Black Jelly Beans &amp;amp; Smokes &lt;/a &gt;."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

Or is W really a mystic who just wants to distinguish these from science? Why doesn't he just write more and explain himself?

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing the beginning (through around 3.1) of Wittgenstein's &lt;em &gt;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus &lt;/em &gt;. Mr. W. wrote that the world is made up of facts (as opposed to things) and that these facts can be analyzed into atomic facts, but then refused to give even one example to help us understand what the hell he's talking about, and so Wes and Mark argue about it per usual while Seth corrects our German pronunciation. The first 3/4 of this episode was recorded off-site from our regular equipment, making the audio quality relatively sucky.

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;Discussing Plato's "Apology."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This reading is all about how Socrates is on trial for acting like an ass and proceeds to act like an ass and so is convicted. Big surprise. On this our inaugural discussion, Mark, Seth, and Wes talk about how philosophers are arrogant bastards who neglect their children, how people of all political stripes don't usually examine their fundamental beliefs (but probably should), why it might be better to know you know nothing than to only think that you know nothing, and how Plato was a super genius all of whose texts you should worship uncritically. Plus: podcaster philosophical origin stories, like when Wes was bitten by a radioactive Anaxagoras.&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Read along in this &lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html" target="_blank"&gt;free online version &lt;/a &gt;of the text, or try this: &lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456490613/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 &amp;amp;camp=1789 &amp;amp;creative=9325 &amp;amp;creativeASIN=1456490613 &amp;amp;linkCode=as2 &amp;amp;tag=theparexalif-20 &amp;amp;linkId=QQPI2GQWM7GUGHHN" target="_blank"&gt;Plato's Apology of Socrates: A New Translation, in the Style of a Cinematic Novella &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;. &lt;/p &gt;&lt;/html &gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;html &gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;em &gt;Hey, folks. We're looking for audio clips of no more than 2 minutes reacting to this episode and/or telling about how PEL has affected your life. We'll patch some of these together to make some kind of ep. 300-accompanying release and/or maybe hold a recorded Zoom call with up to 10 of you to accompany the public version of this episode. Send your submissions as mp3s to &lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;&lt;a href="http://mailto:mark@partiallyexaminedlife.com" target="_blank"&gt;mark@partiallyexaminedlife.com &lt;/a &gt;&lt;/em &gt;&lt;em &gt;.&lt;/em &gt;&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;Mark Linsenmayer, Seth Paskin, and Wes Alwan discuss Plato's "Apology."&lt;/p &gt;&lt;p &gt;This reading is all about how Socrates is on trial for acting like an ass and proceeds to act like an ass and so is convicted. Big surprise. On this our inaugural discussion, we talk about how philosophers are arrogant bastards who neglect their children, how people of all political stripes don't usually examine their fundamental beliefs (but probably should), why it might be better to know you know nothing than to only think that you know nothing, and how Plato was a super genius all of whose texts you should worship uncritically.
